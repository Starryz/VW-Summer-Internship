The Media Design Matters (MDM) program at Art Center College of Design will embark on a partnership with UNICEFs Innovation team and the UNICEF Innovation Lab in Kampala, Uganda. The program joins one of the worlds leading colleges of design with the expertise of the worlds leading organization for the rights and well-being of children and youth. The main objectives of the program are: (1) To develop new information and communication technologies for youth development, empowerment, and expression; and (2) To nurture the formation of interdisciplinary E-Teams that will work with UNICEF specialists and collaborators in local communities in Uganda in the design of these new technologies to ensure their longer-term sustainability and scalability in real-world settings. MDM's faculty combines a strong background in design innovation, ethnographic research methods, and community ICT development, as well as practical methods for creating sustainable social innovations. Talented students will work with this faculty and form their own E-Teams with each other, local researchers, and social innovators with complementary expertise, to identify needs and create new technologies and communication platforms for youth empowerment. The E-Teams and their collaborators will design products and services using methods from open, participatory models of innovation and co-production. Together, they will prototype, test, and refine these technologies, with the aim of building long-term systems for their continued operation and scaling as social enterprises in the form of non-profits, commercial operations, or open technologies.
