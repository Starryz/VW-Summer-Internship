 Happy New Year and thanks for your email. I think I’ve identified the source of the confusion. The comment re identifying a Brazilian partner came from one of our reviewers who made an assumption that you were most focused on Brazil (you mention India, East Africa and Brazil on page 3 of the narrative, but in re-reading the paragraph, you are talking about Envirofit’s focus, not the Hydraulic Hybrid Retrofit program). That being said, I see that you have in your workplan (chart on p. 6) to identify the location   Q4 2007 & Q1 2008 and establish a relationship with a partner Q1 and  Q2 2008. Will you choose the location then the partner or vice versa? Because the right partner is so often the most important criteria for success, the reviewers were anxious about that piece not being identified. Given the CSU team’s track record, NCIIA is comfortable in funding the grant with your proposed timeline for identifying a partner; please keep us posted via email of your progress/decisions on this front.
 
 Second, can you please expand on the way you see the carbon credit program working or is this also something that will depend on the location and partners?
 
 We are delighted to support this program and look forward to having you at our kickoff workshop in Dallas on 3/19/08.

Jennifer,
 
Thanks for the clarification.  I assume that this means we are all set to proceed and that we just need to keep working and keep you informed of our progress. I have tried to address your questions below.
 
Ideally, we will choose both the location and partners together.  As you stated, having a good partner is critical and our hopes are that we will be able to find the right partner in the right location. Identify both of these is the top priority of the business team right now.  Our approach is to try and identify a location that would 1) benefit greatly from this technology 2) have favorable economic conditions, including carbon credits, for widespread adoption of the technology and 3) have a good partner located there to work with.  We really need to have all three to make this project a success and are confident that we can do that.
 
The carbon credits is something that we are also looking into already.  Envirofit International has been doing a lot of research on carbon credits in the transportation field, and we’re reviewing that material with them.  Also, we’re trying to sort out the information that came out of the conference in Bali.  How exactly we will utilize the value of carbon will definitely depend on the location we select, as this is a relatively new source of revenue and differs from location to location.  How developed the carbon markets are in different countries will clearly be a factor in the location selection.

We will keep you up to date on our progress.
 
Once again, thank you for all of your help.

Hi Mark,

We have reviewed the additional information requested by reviewers that you submitted at the end of January. That information, and what I heard in the Global Resolve Panel that I participated on satisfies our need to further information and we are ready to confirm the funding of the grant.

In the response that you sent us you requested Paul Hudnut's contact information (his team has developed cookstoves for India and the project is now part of Envirofit International). It sounded like you had made contact with Paul, but in case you haven't you can reach him at paul.hudnut@business.colostate.edu. I also believe he's coming to the NCIIA conference and SV workshop.

One last question, I wonder if your gelfuel stove team is going to participate in the ASU Launchpad program that Dan O’Neil is involved with? (I realize he’s one of your advisors). We highly recommend this experience for your team.

Looking forward to seeing you in Dallas, Jennifer

Jennifer:
 
Thanks for your consideration as to whether we can use some of the funds for travel to the conference for two students that have been and will be part of our global health activities on the NCIIA grant.  As it stands now, I will only attend the workshop and my estimated expenses including hotel are about $300. Chris King, my co-PI, would now like to stay for the workshop and conference and his budget needs are now about $1,000 including registration for the workshop.   So our total is approximately $1,300 for the two of us. Our two graduate students, Jason Kennedy and Dana Hage, will arrive for the conference during the evening of March 18 and depart Dallas on March 23. They will not need hotel lodging so I expect their needs will be about $750 per person or $1,500.  Our total expenses should be under $3,000 for the four of us.  I will make sure that our submittal for expenses to your agency will not exceed that amount. I will cover any additional expenses if our cost estimates turn out faulty.  Thank you. Roger Lewis.

1005006,2008-02-12,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Notes from f/up call with Bill Jordan, Brian Thomas, Greg Leman, PW, JKJ:

Discussion revolved around the business model and possible replicability/sustainability:

-costs can't exceed affordability. Value proposition needs to work.  They have good reason to believe that the economics make sense.

-driving force is money spent now on other forms of energy that aren't efficient or healthy.

-proof of concept project to make sure technical and economic assumptions work.

-BOOT model - even if the village level works is there is no upfront investment money. So there is a need for outside capital.  Vision is for ownership within the villages. 

So, future $ is from foundations and investments? 
How is the principal recovered? Not sure if they will add interest fee or what the return will be for investors. Ongoing small annual fee that replenishes the fund to build others?

-they will Establish an NGO in Honduras or US – owner / deploy system. A person in each village will be an employee for 2.5 years – paid to maintain, liaison. Rent to own but is getting a salary...(so they are building a business model).

NCIIA’s concern  - this (building the business model)  needs to be in the forefront while they are building the technology. Don’t have a local business/microfinance partner.
– connect to NESST? (and orgs working with Ithaca College in Honduras).

-Plan to have an MBA and another business student help them. (similar to EWB project but potential for self-generating repeating activity – what an EWB project could be.)

Longer term – other projects - biogass, coconut energy (Walter), hydropower – business plan and legal mechanism is important for multiple projects. Might make sense to connect with financing groups with Walter Bradley so there is a knowledge base at Baylor.  

Want to put all teams through Ai2V – Bill? Is getting certified as a super coach.

Phil wants them to set objectives related to economic sustainability. They will email jkj with a self-set deadline to turn in a 1-2 page business model once they figure that out. Can’t put the engineering only up front. JKJ – prompt revised set of objectives for the grant...and a description of what they need to bring to Dallas.
Bill Jordan and Brian Thomas will attend the workshop.

1004941,2008-04-17,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Reallocation request:
We would like to ask for permission from NCIIA to rebudget some of the award we received in December in Sustainable Vision.  

The village chief from Ghana will be here visiting next week to get training on the gel fuel generation system that we will be shipping to his village this summer.  We have several events planned that were not specifically mentioned in the budget and ASU will not alllow these charges unless we get permission from NCIIA.

The changes are as follows:

$1000 transferred out of Travel (out of state)  and $1000 transferred out of Materials and Supplies for expenses of three business meetings/workshops and related meals.

The out of state travel is for the chief’s visit, but only counts for his per diem and airfare and lodging.  We will be including several high level administrators, potential funders in three different workshops:  one on Tuesday to advise him on starting a village venture which involves business faculty, students project leaders, etc. both for a meeting and dinner, one on Wednesday with the Whole Planet Foundation to enable microfinancing of the village venture which includes lunch and one on Thursday to attract additional funds and additional faculty to the project which includes both lunch and dinner.  All three of these involve meals that can’t be reimbursed from the current budget unless we get permission from you.  It turns out we are not spending as much on the prototype (materials and supplies) as we had thought and we overbudgeted for the chief’s travel, hence we have flexibility in the budget to move $2000 of funds into a category to support the workshops including food, venue rent and probably some other miscellaneous expenses.

Thanks.  His visit is next week and we would like to make sure these changes are okay before he arrives on Monday if possible.  Let me know if you have questions.  All of these events will help the success of the gel fuel project, either directly with the chief or by securing additional future funds for completion of this project.

Thanks for your consideration.

I spoke with Mary Atella in our Office of Sponsored Programs about these charges.  She said that there is really no better subcode for the cost of the shirts than “Materials and Supplies”.   So, we’d like to ‘leave’ the budget, and when we submit our final detailed expense report, the shirts will be reflected in that category.

The total was $850.00.  We plan on giving shirts to all the team members to wear during presentations and events at Colorado State University (for instance, the team got a lot of exposure and support during CSU Engineering Days last week.)We had additional shirts made to give out to donors to this project – we’ve received over $50,000 in donated equipment and hydraulic supplies from various industry partners.  In addition, we’re sending a team to India for 8 weeks in May to lead the business development and partner cultivation there.

My team has asked me to contact NCIIA for some clarification on our grant.  We have purchased a number of shirts and created marketing materials for our “Hydraulic Hybrid for Developing Nations” (NCIIA Grant 4964-07) project. We plan on giving shirts to all the team members to wear during presentations and events at Colorado State University. We had additional shirts made to give out to donors to this project – we’ve received over $50,000 in donated equipment and hydraulic supplies from various industry partners.

When we processed this cost through the University, our office of Sponsored Programs asked me to write and clarify whether these costs can be charged to the Sustainable Vision grant money.  We did budget $30,500 for “Materials and Supplies” – which, during our budget preparation, was the category that made most sense for these kinds of purchases.
 
What are your thoughts?

catastrophic cyclone that has passed through the country on Saturday.

that the devastation in the city is ""very very severe"" - there is no
electricity, water or phone service and that fuel and food supplies
are starting to run low.  The IDE office staff and their families in
Yangon are accounted for, but there are 40 IDE field workers in the
Ayeyarwady Delta and the environs south of Yangon who have not been
accounted for.

We are staying in touch with the Taylors the best we can - but (as you
can understand) will be suspending our project until the area and IDE
can return to some sense of normalcy.  We will keep you updated as we
learn more and how this affects our project timeframe. At the moment it
looks to me like the best course of action is for me to request a six
month no cost extension. I'll do this more formally once things settle
down more and Jim Taylor let us know what he thinks would be best from his
perspective.

The budget for prototyping did not allow us to buy anything unless we moved it into Materials and Supplies.  ASU did not have a suitable category for prototyping.  It just allowed us to pay someone else to build things and didn’t allow us to build them ourselves which saves lots of money and time and improves quality and allows us to do more design iterations.  So, at some point this winter we renamed prototyping to Materials and Supplies in our local account.  I have copied Lacey Ward, our account administrator who can probably give you some more details if you wish.

In order to give you comprehensive information we ( the three Principals) need to meet telephonically to compile the information.  Meanwhile Lingam in South Africa was not immediately available.  But for Tsehai who has all along been working on the business/marketing and financing models, Lingam and I needed to filter our thoughts and to add to the very well considered list already generated by Tsehai.  We will send you our responses this week.  It appears as if Tsehai and his students have done a thorough research on the Ethiopian market in particular as to determine the target market, possible competitions and our relative advantages.  Now with his leadership we are looking at other markets. Lingam and I on the other hand have concentrated more on the technical aspect of our project   but also, due to our long involvement have had some leads we now wish to pursue.  We have also decided to fundamentally redesign our system based on lessons learned from the Dallas workshop last March.  Paying more emphasis on economics in the design we decided to concentrate more on the low cost gravity driven system first.  This we believe will help the company penetrate and establish the market faster and pave the way for the production and marketing of the more expensive more sophisticated CUF. This new emphasis is reflected on the revised workplan/milestones matrix. Please look forward to receiving our response shortly.  Regards

These meeting were somewhat preliminary. We presented a few viable lead battery take-back policies and mechanisms to VEPA, along with a working paper that outlined the pro’s and con’s of each. They will work with us on identifying which combinations will work best. We also presented the plan for the battery eco-label to stakeholders. The next step is to have another follow-up workshop where we integrate the regulation policy with the eco-label with some more specific recommendations, drawing together all interested stakeholders. There have been some discussions of an August or September workshop that will be less introductory and more “hands-on”. In the meantime, we are working on the logistics surrounding the eco-label, like who the inspectors will be and so on. We’ll keep you informed.

I am back from Asia and gearing up for the semester. I had an excellent time working in China and Vietnam this summer on a couple of projects and our Battery Eco-label/Recycling Program is gaining a bit of traction. It is very timely too. In the last couple of weeks, the Vietnamese government deregulated fuel prices, causing a 30%+ price jump, practically overnight. This has caused a bit of buzz about electric scooters becoming popular in Vietnam and has raised issues on several fronts about lead pollution vis-à-vis local air quality and GHG  improvements. E-scooters have a bad stigma in Vietnam currently because they are perceived to be junky Chinese e-bicycles. However, I showed some images of larger e-scooters to Vietnamese policy makers and suggested that e-scooters could be quite competitive with motorcycles and some of them agreed. The market will decide if e-scooters can demonstrate they perform well and are cost effective. This is the time for Vietnam to develop a robust lead recovery policy and manage battery production and thankfully we are able to be there and help in the ways we can.
 
This leads to my next question. As a current grantee, is it possible to apply for SV grant in the coming round? While in Vietnam, I met an entrepreneur, Dave Evers, (and gave a joint presentation with him to the Vietnam emissions regulators). He is in the process of starting the “Vietnam Green Transportation Initiative”, whose primary goal is to develop the electric scooter industry and remove some of the current stigma through some demonstration projects. We have been talking about partnering on this project, starting with a “Corporate Partner E-bike Program”, where we enlist large employers, generally large multinational corporations, to endorse e-scooter use for their employees, generally with some incentives such as purchase subsidy, preferred parking, free helmets, free recharging…and so on. The corporation would benefit by receiving some “green points” from a PR perspective and improving the cost-effectiveness of the transport of their employees, improving their well-being. Google buses is a good model of a company taking partial care of transportation needs of its employees. Major companies in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi could find a benefit for participating. Companies would also pay a small partner fee to Vietnam Green Transportation Initiative to help manage the system. Once enough companies have bought into this, there could be a critical mass of e-scooter users that would induce more shift, removing some of the negative perceptions. I’ve attached the powerpoint that Dave Evers presented.
 
Does this seem like something the NCIIA might be interested in jump starting with a SV grant?

I hope you are having a nice summer.  I wanted to update you as to the status of our NCIIA project (4979-07 Strengthening Manufacturing Capacity of Burmese Metalworking Firms to Promote Sustained Development).

Our partner organization, IDE-Myanmar, spent the summer primarily doing relief work (not something they usually do) following the cyclone.  They were successful in reaching many of the more remote and isolated communities that had been affected and were able to distribute rice seeds in time for the planting season.  Jim and Debbie Taylor report that things are still relatively grim - rural life savings (stored crops and livestock) were wiped out, but overall people are hopeful about the future.

David Klaus, a former Masters degree student who served last year as a d.school Fellow and assisted in teaching our Design for Extreme Affordability course, just took at fulltime position with IDE-Myanmar (starting last week).  We are very excited to have him in Yangon and also involved in our project from IDE's side..

3 sold arts and crafts and dying (African products), one association with a cyber cafe, 1 woman sold fish, food transformation (syrup or juice for example)...all entrepreneurs. Some educated, some not. Made a list of software that will be useful for them. Met with Mamadou's students in July 08 - in a dorm outside the city. Got to know them. Doing an online competition with the students - prizes are ipods. Ind. and team competitions- winning teams go to the bootcamp. About 30 students competing individually. 10 teams, can only take 6 in the bootcamp. Teams will be matched to women entrepreneurs.

 In Jan. 09,  will teach mobile phone programming for 10 days/bootcamp. Senegalese students will meet the female entrepreneurs. Christelle plans to  give them support to develop their own businesses. Some will develop mobile phone apps, some will develop websites for the women. Understanding expenses and income is important - these women want/need this.
There will be judges (from the mobile phone industry and other local entrepreneurs in Senegal) to judge the students work at the end of the bootcamp. Winning teams will be incubated by NCNW to go further.  Hopes to make a short film of the bootcamp.

In Oct. 09 Mamadou will develop a course for all his 120 students (half women) on java etc. Anita from Stoneybrook is teaching a seminar course, trying out applications, so they know what students should focus. Students are motivated to start their own companies due to high unemployment but they don't know how. Non winning teams will also get some eship support, to be defined. Trying to create a community of volunteer judges from industry to help support these students. She sees this (grant work) as a proof of concept - if this works, will decide how to replicate.

Jennifer,
First to answer your question about student involvement:
As far as student involvement, we have a Stanford Mechanical
Engineering graduate student, Vickie Chaing who is on the project now and
will be the student leader on the Stanford end. She will go to Myanmar at
the same time I go there to give some workshops at IDE in December.
Starting Winter Quarter we expect that there may be as many as six student
teams (3-4 people each) in the Design for Extreme Affordability class
working on IDE-Myanmar projects, and these projects will all have a
manufacturing component which Vickie and Krista Donaldson will
coach. 
Also, I'm hoping that IDE will have some Burmese student engineering
interns on their end that we will also bring into the project in the new year.
As far as Neil Copperrider is concerned I consider him as one of the
outside experts that we included in the original proposal under the
budget heading of ""Other Stipends.""
I do think it is within the scope of what we have envisioned to use Neil's
experise as a designer and teacher.

Local utilities are losing money in rural Honduras - people are stealing, can't hire enough people to do bill collection. Amount of energy families use are too small to justify expenses for the utility companies. Team's idea is to generate electricity locally. Micro franchising model to estab village level companies - maintain, prevent theft, do billing and collection. Rural people are highly motivated to participate/get electricity. They have established a company with 3 families (hiring families not individuals). Father who is illiterate checks the concrete, does repairs, his son reads the meters.

They maintain, collect bills. On a  monthly basis a technician comes around and collects $, makes payroll. 

Now they have one village that is working, want to do 5-10 more. Using book Microfranchising in the Dev World book. Business in a box. First ten villages would be corporate owned franchises with the possibility of employee ownership later on. BOOT (Build own operate and tranfer model) - they build and own, they teach employees to operate and transfer ownership in 5 years to employees after they've recouped their expenses for the equipment. Franchising fee would be paid by each franchisee.

Village Energy will incorporate in the US, both US and Honduran lawyers working on this. Owners are outside investors plus Greg & Ryan; Ryan graduates in a few months, will move to Honduras if they can get funding. Want to deploy 500 units - target 100k people in 5 years. So far have been focused on one village. Word of mouth travels fast - people want them to come to their village.

Challenges - legal issues - lots of red tape and corruption requires good lawyers. Finance - need more $ to install other systems. They will talk to Paul Polak this week at Baylor and will ask him about Husk Power. (They are further along than this team; they are focused on India - complementary not competitive per Joseph.) Billing: now low cost meters in each home which displays / can watch the rate climb as they use appliances. Considering a product made to install on a pole outside the home. If they use an excess of power, it trips. Safe. Would have to change to a flat rate billing system. 

This solution is limited to villages with rivers running through - there are a lot of these villages. It's a rainforest - lots of streams, lots of water. Also looked at bio diesel, but think hydro is the way to go. Will send draft powerpoint to us. Next call scheduled for 10/29. jkj

1004964,2008-10-30,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Yes - we're quite excited about how this project has developed.  Frankly, the NCIIA funding was HUGE in terms of securing other funding.  We were able to build a running prototype using those funds, and have covered some good ground in terms of business development - all possible using NCIIA funds.  Those funds very much enabled us to hit the ground running, and for that, we'll always be grateful.

We are quite serious about pursuing market opportunities in the US.  For instance, UPS has just agreed to add some Hydraulic Hybrids to their fleet.  While they are not going to use our design, companies like UPS have shown considerable interest in the technology.  We've gotten a lot of support from the University, the City of Fort Collins, NCIIA, etc... and we're confident that our design modifications to be done this year will be even more fuel efficient (while reducing particulate emissions) than our current design, and better than the design UPS is testing.  Czero is confident that we'll have a good product that can gain market access.

1005028,2008-11-10,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Interim report follow up:
Regarding question #1 relating to technical / behavioral problems, there have been several problems identified.  The principle operational component of these filters is a ceramic ""candle"" formed of diatomaceous earth, and filled with activated charcoal.  In general, these candles have a high efficiency of removal of bacteria and protozoal cysts.   Water movement through these filters is relatively slow, approximately 1L / Hour.  Some filters quickly clog altogether (within a week) while others have been used successfully for years.   Determining whether this is due to quality control of the candles, characteristics of the source water, or user behavior remains a question.  We are beginning a collaboration with our bio-engineering program to involve undergraduate students in these questions. 
 
Cleanliness is a deeply ingrained part of the Dominican culture.  We suspect that one behavioral aspect that may reduce flow is washing of the candles with soap or detergent, which would immediately blind the fine pores of the filter media.  Another behavioral issue influencing water quality is the modification of the design by the user to increase flow.  For instance, candles have been observed to have been deeply scored in an effort to ""open-up"" the filters to allow greater flow.  Since the training of the 220 cooperadoras, we are hoping to notice a reduction these behavior issues, as these lay health workers will be able to provide more frequent oversight and user support.
 
Overall, I do believe these are issues that can be overcome, even if it requires that we use a difference treatment method. 
 
Regarding your second question relating to affordability, we do use a microfinance system to help households make the purchase of these filters.  The filters are currently sold for US $31, payable by monthly installments over a period of one year.     The filters cost approximately US $16 to make; the remainder is used for the salary of the coordinator, transportation / distribution costs, and the service of the cooperadora.  This is a considerable expense for many families, but when compared with cost of bottled water (the only reasonable alternative) the filter pays for itself within four months.  The greatest unknown is what the default rate might be.  We have anticipated a 10% default rate and compensated for that in the filter costs. If we can sell 600 units annually we should be able to maintain the coordinator's salary, and pay for transportation and distribution costs. 
 
I hope this helps, please let me know if you have other questions.

Thanks so much for your recent update - you may be in Mail still, so no pressure to respond to this email anytime soon.

A few thoughts - 

First, I hope you are able to  take advantage of our offer of the Advanced I2V workshop Aug. 16-19 in Cambridge, MA. (Let me know if you need more details, you have a couple of emails on this I think). You seem to be at a tipping point - lots of demand which is great news! I think the workshop will help begin the process of developping a commercialization plan and a way to reach more villages.

Second, I was interested to see that you have been making contacts with USAID and others - have you had any luck there? We too have been nosing around to see what funding avenues might exist to do faculty development workshops and provide more grant funds for people doing work targeting poor people.

Finally, I took a peek at your new website. Would it be possible to add a link to NCIIA (and acknowledge our funding) so that others who are doing similar work might find us in the future?

I hope your trip goes / went well and I look forward to getting some photos if you are willing to share - thanks! Jennifer

1005006,2009-06-01,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"UPDATE: PROFIT!! Dear Jennifer,

I just returned from another two week trip in Honduras; I was pleased with our progress.  We have upgraded the equipment and made repairs to equipment in the village called Danta Uno, where we have had a functioning electricity business since last August!  We expect to make a profit this month, our first.  We also made much progress towards starting a new business in another village of about 300 people.  Another Baylor business professor, Blaine McCormick, has become another advisor to our company, Village Energy Inc., and joined us for a week teaching entrepreneurship to village families and helping us market ourselves in the Honduran culture.  For example, he pointed out to us that many Honduran companies use ""color branding"" by painting buildings and signs with the exact same logo and color scheme, so that when you see the color, you associate it with the company.

The Honduran counterpart to our US company, Village Energy Inc., is called Energía Para Aldeas (energy for villages).  We created a logo and chose the yellow color for our ""color brand"".  The second photo is of Blaine and our student volunteers with our with our newly painted powerhouse (a small building that houses our tools and equipment).  I also included a picture of the pico hydroelectric canal and one of a woman with a sewing machine.  Her plan is to start using the electricity to go into business as a dress maker.  This is a good example of the type of spin-off businesses we endeavor to stimulate with the energy we deliver.

I wanted you to know that we are still going full speed ahead on this project, and thank you again for the help, coaching, and SDG grant from last year.

1005006,2009-06-02,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"more details: Jennifer,

Here is a summary of the two villages in which we have been working the most and some plans for the future:

Danta Uno
-built a pico hydroelectric generation, ran about 2 miles of distribution lines to homes, established a business to operate and maintain in 2008
-hit by lightning in fall of 2008, shipped replacement electronics to Honduran employee who repaired system
-large flood damaged equipment in river in winter, 2008, had to use diesel generator as back up system for spring until we could repair it in May
-from winter until May, operated electricity from 6-9 PM only using diesel generator, fuel costs and employee costs were too high to make a profit
-repaired flood damage last month, restructured billing system, restructured employee pay, expect to make a profit in June
-24 houses served, plus one church, approximately 110 people with electricity
-new potential businesses: sewing business (immediate future), recharging cell phones (now functioning), potential irrigation pump operation and corn grinding businesses in future, potentially selling ice and cold drinks?

Pueblo Nuevo
-installed a pico hydroelectric generator in 2007, power used to provide lights for a house and a church, also a cell phone charging business (they charge 5 Lempiras, they used to have to walk a mile and pay 10 Lempiras (about $0.50)), tried unsuccessfully to start a battery charging business for deep cycle batteries and rechargeable lanterns
-in 2008 repaired/upgraded equipment above and surveyed village for future project
-in May 2009, launched electricity business, ran 2+ miles of lines to about 50 homes
-plan to operate on diesel generator until we receive next level of funding (need about $5-6k more) when we can build a hydroelectric generator
-established business to maintain equipment and collect fees, expect it to be profitable immediately (June) based on what we learned about billing system and employee pay in Danta Uno
-Ryan McGhee, recent Mater of Engineering and Master of Business Administration graduate, is living in Honduras now (and for the last month) completing construction with locals and incubating these businesses

Future Villages
-we have identified several villages in the area that have suitable hydro resources.  Several other communities have approached us expressing interest in having our systems in their villages!
-we have determined that it will be best if we target some of the larger communities without electricity that have existing commercial districts, that way we can start with the town centers and existing business owners and, over time, expand into residential areas.  There are several such communities that we know about, but we have not yet approached them because we felt we had to work out a few more bugs first.  These would likely be larger systems than we have done so far.  This is in keeping with our initial findings that the larger the system, the more financially viable it will be.  This is not really surprising, however, since that is the reason the rural areas don't have power now!

Future funding
-we have caught the attention of a local Rotary club that would like to give us $10,000 annually for the next few years, but we are running into some eligibility problems because we are for-profit. (The Rotary's understanding of establishing businesses for international development and poverty abatement is a little behind the times, so we are trying to ""educate"" them.)
-We have partnered with a non-profit organization in Honduras called AHPPER which is their primary organization in support of small renewable energy systems in their country.  They provide us with legal and environmental recommendations.  Together, our two organizations have entered a competition sponsored by the Inter American Development Bank which has several million dollars to give away for ""innovative energy delivery systems for impoverished peoples in Latin America"" - so we are a good fit!  I hope that we get invited to the second round of proposals, and ultimately receive their $200,000 grant.  That would be exactly what we need!  We should know by the end of summer.
-if we receive the above grant, we will try to do 6-12 more villages in the coming year.  This will allow us to more fully develop our installation methods (it is taking us too long and costing us too much now) and work out operational procedures and cost reduction technologies.  Then we feel we would be to the point of really having the ""business in a box"" so that it could be truly franchised.  Then we will seek triple bottom line investors to fund our franchisOR costs.  We may have found a funding source for the capital costs associated with the franchisEE.  That is an investment group called E+Co which invests in energy projects in the developing world (http://www.eandco.net/).  We have spoken with them and they are interested in providing loans for the individual businesses.  Of course, this is not a sure thing, but it is a good lead.


Jennifer, I hope I haven't given you more answers than you asked for!  It was actually helpful for me to summarize these things for myself.

Hi Jennifer,  

Thanks for introducing me to Zubaida, we are trying to arrange a time to talk about our projects.  I really appreciate you thinking about putting us together!

As of last month we about 550 filters sold and orders for approximately 150 more.  When Jason and I where there in June our team constructed these filters, so they were ready to go.  The NGO we have been working with experienced significant funding losses this year resulting in a reduction of staff, including our coordinator.  They assured me that operations would continue as planned.

1005028,2009-08-28,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Chris will send a separate email requesting a no cost ext. Update:

The coordinator who was hired for the water program (Osvaldo) was a technician level employee.  He was responsible for assembling the filters, managing inventory, making deliveries, assisting with training and revenue collection.  His activities were overseen by a manager (Veronica) who was  responsible for taking orders, collecting revenues, and generally insuring that the program was in order.   

When the NGO faced a US $150,000 shortfall, they began making cut-backs, including Osvaldo.  Veronica continues in her duties, and directs the program as before using other staff in place of Osvaldo.  Veronica was trained in all aspects of the program in June, and she is very competent (She has a BS in chemical engineering).  The executive director has assured me that they are committed to keeping the water program going and the current staff will do fine with it.  I can only trust them on this.  I believe they are sincere, but I fear the loss of Osvaldo's passion.  He was truly committed to this project, doing whatever was necessary to get the job done.  He had pride in his ""ownership"" of the program.   I know it was a difficult decision for the executive director to let Osvaldo go, because he had nurtured Osvaldo over the years through part-time employment.  

I intend to remain involved with the water program.  A professor at Creighton university, Gary Michels, brings a group of students each June to work with the program, and I will continue to join them then or go later in the summer when our graduate students go down.

Although the project goals have been met and the program should in principle be sustainable, it would be very beneficial to continue monitoring the program until July 2010 to better assess the program's sustainability.  If there are difficulties in this coming year we should be able to identify the contributing factors, adding greater value to the ""lessons learned"" of our final report.

Ryan is living on air, he's graduated. 

Village Energy is soon to be incorporated in TX. Told them about Lex Mundi - they have a second meeting with a lawyer soon.

PROJECT UPDATE

Ryan is the team leader; he did most of the talking. He's graduated and was in Honduras in summer. 

TECHNICAL: 2 villages 5-6 miles apart, an hour's drive between them.

Two systems - hydro system (SV grant) generates electricity 4hrs/ day - 23 homes (4.5 people per house)

diesel system installed this summer - installed the grid side, 3hrs/day of electricity - temp. until they can get down again and install the hydro - 40 households (4.5 people per house)

using insulated cables (less of a safety risk)
power poles can be very expensive - using native wood that sprouts a new tree when cut - termite resistant, inexpensive
waterproof, enclosed circuit breaker
each house gets 120V/i amp/100watts, if they go above, it will shut down and 15 sec. later come back
one plug in each house

People buy lightbulbs first - 10 times more light than kersosene
second, cell phone charging instead of walking an hour a day
some richer families are getting tv's

customers are getting accustomed to a monthly electric bill  - now half of what it will be. 

Ryan did his master's thesis on this.

FRANCHISE MODEL
Each house pays a monthly bill; each village has 3 p/t employees. One hour of work per household per month - includes maintenance (trim live trees, walking every line), collecting $, giving advice, theft prevention (stealing electricity).  Employees are part owners, at the end of 5 yrs, they will be 1/10 owners (30%) and Village Energy will own 70%
-avg is about $16k loan per employee.

looking to lower $ per household for each system (all costs divided by house = $200/household is the goal, now $350)

Recent grant is enough to do 9 more systems. At the end of a year, they want to go to World Bank or InterAm Dev Bank (right of first refusal) for loans; once they have a year under their belt and can prove repayment.

Happy new year to you.  Thanks for your mail.  I am pleased to give you an update on our project.  We have had a number of meetings with Dr Ervin Williams, the Entrepreneur in Residence at SSU Center for Business Growth and Entrepreneurship.  So far he has introduced us (an our product) to one outside business person who seems to show an interest in the product.  Yet, there is nothing concrete to report from those meetings.  Dr Williams has more recently suggested that we develop a proposal (together with him) which he would share with Social Entrepreneur funders. He is to lead the effort by producing the first draft based on the information he gathered from us during the meetings and the demonstrations we presented. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity you offered is to participate in the workshop.  It was very helpful.  It confirmed some of our speculations and further provided us a focus on how to approach our search for funding.  It is really from the comments and recommendations of the judges during the presentation that it became convincingly clear that our chances of finding venture capitalists and/or angel  investors for a product for poor people in impoverished countries are not that good.  We are instead focused on finding  Social Entrepreneur funders and NGOs both bilateral and in African countries.  We have started to take the incremental steps to prepare us for success in this paradigm.  First we have embarked on improving product quality by introducing disinfection unit in order to meet the standards of bilateral agencies.  Next we are organizing a large scale field trial to produce data that would convince potential funders of product effectiveness.  I will send you details of our efforts in these regards and other exiting things about our project.  Below is the summary of some project highlights. 
 
Further funding has been acquired for the disinfection studies and system optimization/robust design; two disinfection protocols have been tried with very good results; A European based NGO  doing humanitarian work in Africa has expressed interest in our system; A Pakistani relief agency has expressed an interest in our system for disaster relief applications; A workshop was conducted at Nqabeni village in Eastern Cape, South Africa (funded by South African Netherlands Partnership for Alternative Development - SNPAD) in preparation for a large scale field trial with participation of the rural people - end users.  Progress is being made in the plant design for semi automatic production.
 
Thank you again for your support without which we could have not gone this far.  Regards

I hope you are well. Congratulations on the work completed to date on the water heater. I had the opportunity to meet your student Levi at the AI2V workshop we just held at Stanford; he did a great job on his final presentation, by the way and seemed to get a lot out of the workshop despite attending without other team members. It seems that since he is new to the team, he's not completely up on all the latest developments, so I wonder if I can check in with you on the following:

-how many students are still working on this project?
-when do you expect the first sale to be made? (in Mexico, not Guatemala?)
-you did not submit a final expenditure report - please see attached template
-could we get some photos from you - Levi seemed to have some good ones 

Finally, now the the grant period has ended, have you secured enough other funding to continue? We of course want to see the work continue and hope that you will be able to launch this in an economically sustainable way. 

I hope we'll see you at our conference in March in SF(http://nciia.org/network/conference/2010) It would be great to see you. Regards, Jennifer

1005028,2010-01-29,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Hi Jennifer,  

I hope things are going well.  

I've recently been in contact with the coordinator in the DR in our efforts to send filter units to Haiti.  She mentioned things were going well, but I don't have any recent data.  Roger and I are travelling to the DR early in March to work on a number of different initiatives and we will be spending some time at the ILAC Center with the executive director and the water program coordinator.  We have found face to face visits to be  much more fruitful; it seems there is a cultural barrier that impedes satisfying communication by telephone or email.  However, when we meet in person things go well.  So, if you are OK with a delay, I'll be able to accurately report an update by mid-March, just in time for the conference and our presentation.  

Similarly, poor communication is impeding our efforts in Haiti.  Understandably our contacts on the ground there are overwhelmed with the circumstances.  We are still making efforts to gain some assurances that the filter units can be properly received and distributed, but at this point these assurances are nebulous at best.  We are reluctant to seek NCIIA resources until we can be assured that there is a reasonable probability that the units will be properly distributed and used.  We are pursuing a number of different possibilities, hopefully something will work out.  This may be another issue of needing to be there. 

So, if its OK, I'll update you as indicated.  We really appreciate the quick response and support from everyone at NCIIA in regard to our Haiti plans.  Hopefully we'll be able to move forward with this soon.  

Best, 

Chris

1005006,2010-02-01,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"
We overspent the original budget a considerable amount on travel.  However we underspent a considerable amount on faculty stipends and other stipends.  We did most of the project with students who were volunteering their time and efforts to assist us on the project.  Many of them were willing to work for free if we could help them with the travel costs.  This lead us to use the “other stipend” amount to help with student travel.  The faculty stipend portion of the budget was to provide salary support for Professor Thomas to work on the project in the summers.  As a twelve month employee of Baylor I also worked in the summers but did not need any salary support.  In order to get the project to completion Professor Thomas was willing to work for less than the budgeted stipend to allow us to bring more students to help on the project.
 
What this means is that we had students who were willing to work on the project without salary for help with their travel costs.  By spending money on travel rather than stipends we were able to involve more students on the project, thus allowing us to get more done.
 
If you have any questions, do not hesitate to further contact us.  We have enjoyed working on this project and we look forward to future projects with the NCIIA.

Hope you are doing well! It was brought to my attention that I missed answering your question regarding our funding situation.

We are currently funded through the UC Berkeley Center for Energy and Environmental Innovation fellowship. Our funding will last us till mid-spring 2010. However, we are continually seeking funding opportunities to apply for to continue our project.

Please let us know if there are more opportunities for us through NCIIA or if you could refer us to other avenues. We understand that the NCIIA funding is more for projects that are ready to launch to market. Although we are not there yet, that is the direction we are pursuing.

In response to your questions:  

A- There are 7 current members on the team and 2 advisors. Prof. Gadgil is our PI and we also work with a mentor scientist from LBNL, Howdy Goudey.

     3 current UC Berkeley Students: Sara Al-Beaini (Mechanical Engineering PhD student), Kenneth Armijo (ME PhD student), Levi Goertz (MBA student).

     4 UC Berkeley recent alumni: Merwan Benhabib (Mechanical Engineering, PhD '09), Alissa Johnson (Material Science Engineering, MS '07),  Adam          Langton (Public Policy, MS '07), Ernesto Rodriguez (MBA '09)

B- We don't expect the first sale to be made before Jan 2011. The first sale date will become more definitive based on our progress this spring and summer 2010.

C- We have attached the completed financials template. We do recall filling in the numbers through the online link in the financials section. We're wondering if there was a separate submission button we missed for that portion of the final report.

D- Attached are a couple of photos of the team and a solar water heater in Xela, Guatemala. We would also like to mail you some copies of a children's science book on our solar water heater project. The book was put together through the Lawrence Hall of Science and just got published. What would be the preferred mailing address?

Please let us know if there is more information we can provide.
