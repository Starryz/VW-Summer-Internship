Conserving wildlife and alleviating poverty through wildlife-friendly enterprises,50000,Conserving wildlife and alleviating poverty through wildlife-friendly enterprises,University of Wisconsin-Madison, ,2007-10-10,2007-10-22, , ,"Wealthy consumers and corporations are increasingly concerned with social and environmental responsibility. The rural poor living alongside charismatic, endangered wildlife in far-away, wild places can benefit from the wealthy markets that result. Otherwise, developing-country producers have little reason to tolerate tigers, elephants or bears that eat their crops or livestock. Without human tolerance, these animals are unlikely to survive for long. Linking responsible consumers who love animals to producers able to protect their property and coexist with wildlife could alleviate poverty and conserve wildlife simultaneously. For such wildlife-friendly enterprises to take root and flourish, producers must reach enough consumers and these consumers need confidence their purchases truly contribute to poverty alleviation and wildlife conservation. Enter the Wildlife Enterprise Network (WEN), a consortium of 26 private-sector and non-profit organizations from eight countries, co-founded by the UW-Madison principal investigator. WEN members help producers coexist with imperiled wildlife and reach lucrative markets. Promising pilot products include Tiger-Friendly® ginseng (Russian Far East), Elephant Pepper® (southern Africa), and Snow Leopard Trust® wool products (Mongolia) among others. This proposal marshals the business and environmental expertise of a major university to bring selected wildlife-friendly products to market readiness. Specifically, we will     train producers in Western consumer values, import/export requirements, and quality criteria of retailers;      transfer technology and train rural communities to protect property, manage wildlife non-lethally and verify wildlife are thriving; and     measure consumer satisfaction with products and marketing (with pro bono support from Dupuis Group).",1004963,Not Accepted,4963-07,0017000001LSVu9AAH,a2C39000002zYt3EAE,012390000009qIDAAY,The Lemelson Foundation

This grant will support continuing work for the development of a water de-mineralization system, known as the High Intensity De-ionization System (HIDS), suitable for manufacture, implementation, and maintenance in poverty-stricken regions.  The current HIDS is capable of removing numerous unwanted minerals from water.  The ultra-low power requirements make it an attractive alternative to other purification methods.  In addition, HIDS is designed for manual fabrication of most components and easy, low-cost maintenance.  The areas below are critical to rendering the HIDS transferable to developing regions and will be the focus of this investigation.         Efforts will focus on increasing the ion-capture capacity of the de-mineralizing coils to improve the performance of the HIDS for ground water with high mineral content for the Native American areas in the desert southwest.

Porous ceramic filters represent a promising option in many places, but the technology is susceptible to breakage and high fuel costs to fire the ceramic.  Porous concrete filters, however, offer many advantages over ceramic filters while incorporating their basic design features contributing to sustainability and usability.  This research project aims to advance the science behind porous concrete filters to produce an effective water quality intervention for use in poor countries, where the need for effective low-cost systems is greatest.        This project aims to:     Develop an innovative, low-cost, effective water treatment device consisting of a porous concrete pot filter;     Extensively test the system s effectiveness against key waterborne pathogens and pathogen indicators; and     Conduct a household-based field trial of the technology in Kandal Province, Cambodia.

Aquaponics integrates aquaculture (growing fish for human consumption) and hydroponics (cultivation of plants in a nutrient-rich solution) into a closed, re-circulating system. The project has three main goals:        Help the students become more aware that the material presented in the classroom is indeed relevant, and has applications to everyday life. This experience is hoped to stimulate the students  desire for knowledge and additional, formal education.     Increase concern for the importance of proper nutrition, since all the students in the class will have some access to fresh and nutritious vegetables. One family in, particular, who will have a mini-aquaponic system in their home, will significantly improve their diet, by their increased consumption of fresh vegetables and fish.     Stimulate entrepreneurial activity by motivating the students to become involved in marketing and selling of excess vegetables to the surrounding community.      The proposed effort aims at building two units, one to be housed at ASU s Polytechnic campus, and the other one at a Native American student s home. Also, an existing unit, already in operation at the middle school, will be retrofitted and enhanced to be equivalent to the two proposed units. A significant feature of the proposed units is that they will be powered by photovoltaic arrays, in order to increase the reliability of the system, and also to expose the students to a major player in the energy solution portfolio.

A Sustainable Hydrogen Fueling System for Automotive Applications,46433,A Sustainable Hydrogen Fueling System for Automotive Applications,California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo, ,2007-10-18,2007-10-19, , ,"Hydrogen is an effective source of energy when available at a reasonable cost, when it can be used properly, and if it is available on demand. It is environmentally friendly, renewable, and can be produced throughout the world. However, other primary sources of energy are required for its production. Renewable energy such as wind, solar, and wave are great sources of energy for this application; they are clean and environment-friendly. One major criticism about these alternative energy sources is that they vary greatly in intensity throughout the day. Storing the energy in the form of electricity is also expensive and impractical. Instead, we are proposing to store renewable energy in the form of hydrogen gas that will be used in automotive applications. A major aspect of this proposal is to design and prototype a distribution system for hydrogen in  bottle-like  small containers with a proper interface that enables ordinary users to burn hydrogen in a slightly modified internal combustion engine. Therefore, many existing cars may immediately be retrofitted to switch to burning hydrogen. We believe that alternate energy should be the source to produce hydrogen and bottle it. This will encourage entrepreneurial activities in wind energy production, in hydrogen production, bottling, and distribution, and in providing a clean and renewable energy source for existing automobiles and other internal combustion engine applications.",1005031,Not Accepted,5031-07,0017000001LSVoGAAX,a2C39000002zYt3EAE,012390000009qIDAAY,The Lemelson Foundation
