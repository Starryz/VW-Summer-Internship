1010027,2013-04-16,Emily Hodos,"Feedback Call Notes from JKJ 1/8/13: On the call: PALI:

Shared the reviewer’s concerns re the eship component and paths to commercialization. Also told him that a couple of reviewers knew him/had heard him speak at our conf. and were concerned re the speed of commercialization (or lack thereof!)

Pali said that the challenge is the “healthcare is free in Nicaragua so coming up with a paid model in rural communities where they have limited funds is a hard sell. Hope that this will resolve itself in the next couple years, will need to see impact.” 

There are lots of opportunities, Lots of rural areas without electricity. UV disinfection system and suction device are what they are working on now plus a  handmill based generator to grind corn – dev. a prototype. I asked - Who is the entrepreneurial lead on getting the suction device to market? His answer:  Pali is the technical lead and students are trying to get FDA approval and a second generation design. UNI doesn’t have a lot of experience in tech eship – Pali and Jim gave a workshop on this to UNI and have identified a few companies that community members are starting, ie solar backpack – she already has a business. So Pali is helping with the technical side and buying 50 bags to sell on campus at Villanova. He’s down in Nicaragua 3-4 times a year – on a board for the UNI Technology Park. Prof. Mon – would continue to support/jointly advise a team post grant period. This would continue post grant period. 

The Tech Park would help mentor the student groups in terms of commercializing their products. Well supported by UNI. Program is strengthening the tie between tech faculty and students and the Tech Park and will mentor them on the tech transfer process. But they are naïve – think they can run off revenue from businesses. 

Budget question: why the student stipend to dev. curricula? At first he said no that was not the plan and then I pointed to his budget note that clearly says that and he said it was for clerical support/developing powerpoints. 

I shared with Pali that we liked the programmatic/educational model but that we’d like to see an equally strong entrepreneurship program. I think he got the message that if he does get funded this time, we need to see commercial outcomes.

1010074,2013-04-16,Emily Hodos,"Feedback Call Notes from JKJ on 1/9/13: On the call Vijay (IIT Dehli) Mark H.

Background
Vijay visited ASU as part of a Fullbright. Co-taught Design for the Dev World with Mark and co-mentored students. Created teams of students from both IIT and ASU. Vijay seems like he has a STRONG eship background and interest – he is currently helping grad students commercialize a household water purification for under $50. Also spinning out his own waste mgmt. solutions company in an off campus incubator. IIT Dehli has both an active TTO (all undergrads own their own IP) and a Tech Business Incubator on campus that has incubated 100+ companies. Learning between ASU and IIT will def. be in both directions.

Q1
Student involvement around idea selection, venture decisions and IP. How will ideas be vetted, projects defined and teams formed? Will the students have the ability to put forth their own ideas? Is there a market/commercialization screening for the proposed projects?

-Yes, all students get to bring in their ideas/projects. Vijay teaches a course of 120 students, not all are creative so for those that don’t come up with their own they give prompts to (from IDDEO and other sources)

Q2
What happens to the technologies/projects post course? Please briefly describe the path to commercialization for the most promising projects after the course ends. List the resources at IIT Dehli and ASU that students can draw upon and, more importantly, is there a structured process to connect teams to these resources?

Q3 
Who is taking the lead on entrepreneurship, as it relates to post course activities?

1010075,2013-04-16,Emily Hodos,"Feedback Call Notes from JKJ on 1/8/13: On the call: Kristin (PI)

Background: 
Been working to set this up for over a year. Have mentored some student teams, Kristin and others from the Aggie Challenge program – but they want to do it differently than Aggie Challenge, since the Challenge is focused on the academic not the commercialization, but helpful to have their support and $$. Student teams are early in the design process, will be ready for the NCIIA funding/new program. Also want to integrate into the study abroad program.

Met with lots of people in Rwanda, their students would be part of the ETeams. Could really get them manufactured and distributed she believes. Students will define the projects.

Partners with 1) Patrick Higiro (sent support letter) from EWH (he works part-time for them– also runs an engineering company.) He works with MOH to make sure hospitals are getting NEW equipment. Well connected politically and a real entrepreneur. Trained in medical equipment but also an entrepreneur – he would target the manufacturing and distribution functions.

2) KIST 
3) another smaller Technical College – will provide space for technical training.

Q1 Eship component – how wil you commercialize.

What is the program’s vision around eship? What process/structures are in place to support student commercialization?

Students, business mentors, Students and individual entrepreneurs from Rwanda would graduate and take this on and Texas A&M would support. Two A&M students want to move back to Cameroon and start a medical device company. 
Lots of young people in Rwanda who are recreating the company (young b/c of the genocide). Believes that Patrick is key to the commercialization efforts; she will speak with Patrick and detail a response on this.

(Kristen has not worked in Africa yet – went to TZ.)

Q2 describe EWH relationship

Sounded like the relationship is with Patrick who works part-time for EWH. We discussed the shift from medical device repair/what EWH does now and what’s proposed; they are pretty separate in Kristin’s mind.",Internal Note,Completed,Normal,00570000004VlXPAA0,Post Award Note--2013/04/16 Emily Hodos

We are getting ready to begin work on the Sustainable Visions grant we received and would like to re-budget the IIT Delhi portion (10074-12).  Do we need to get approval for that?  I have attached the IIT Delhi budget proposal.  It increases prototyping funds and decreases travel.  Can you let me know if you need any other information?

Thanks.

Mark
RESPONSE: Mark, 

I took a closer look at your request and the answer is no, NCIIA does not need to approve sub-awards or provide a budget reallocation in this case. From our perspective, the approved budget that was sent with your award letter (attached) is how we expect the funds to be disbursed and reported on (in those categories/line items). As long as you (ASU and IIT Dehli) do not exceed the line items spelled out in the approved budget, it is up to you to issue the sub-award and manage that transfer of funds and as the PI you have overall responsibility for the use of funds. 

For example, your approved travel is $8,400. Some of this you no doubt used coming to our conference in DC last spring. The remaining funds can be divided between IIT and ASU and include travel related expenses such as airfare, food, hotel etc. As long as the funds are used for travel directly related to the grant and do not exceed $8,400, NCIIA is satisfied. 

Hope this makes sense - let me know if you have any questions. Regards, Jennifer",Internal Note,Completed,Normal,00570000004VlXPAA0,Post Award Note--2013/08/29 Jennifer Keller Jackson
1010027,2013-11-26,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"On the recent NCIIA grant for developing courses to have Villanova and UNI students work together on developing technologies and sustainable business models for rural Nicaraguans, we are making good progress. Prof. Maria Virginia Moncada of UNI has spent the fall semester with us and has been attending some entrepreneurship classes as well as preparing some of the lecture material for the first course. We have the first course approved for offering next spring and I have 8 students signed up for it at Villanova and 7 students at UNI are also ready to take the class. This is a good, manageable number for our first offering of the class. Ed Dougherty, Jim Klingler and I will be heading down to Nicaragua in early January to give an Introduction to Entrepreneurship workshop to UNI students and professors. This will be their initial orientation to business-related concepts. Again, things are moving well and it’s very exciting!
