Freshmen in this seminar will be encouraged to choose a social entrepreneurship idea; 2) a special section of our sophomore level Entrepreneurial Thinking course within our Business Department that would encourage students to develop a required business plan around their social entrepreneurship idea generated in the freshman course. This course exists but would be adapted to focus on social entrepreneurship ideas and plans; 3) A junior course, based on our successful Service Learning Projects course in Interdisciplinary Studies, that would direct students as they implement their ideas in conjunction with a local community nonprofit; 4) A revamped version of our existing Social Entrepreneurship class, taken in conjunction with either an Internship or an Undergraduate Research course, that would allow students to build upon and expand their local community plan to have broader social implications. The goal would be to have students continue their projects on a grander scale after graduation; and 5) A Grant writing lab to give students the tools they need to seek funding for their ideas and their partner organizations.

Farmers mainly grow teff as it s a very drought resistant crop that represents a good source of protein. The separation of the grain from the crop is time- and resource inefficient, and reduces the yield as farmers take their children out of school to help spending days walking their livestock over piles of teff crop to separate out the grain and then pick up the grain from the hard ground afterwards. This program proposes to identify local requirements for a portable threshing machine, and subsequently design a threshing wheel, housing, and drive appropriate for teff threshing and local requirements. Faced challenges of extreme affordability design and limitations in local commercial off the shelf building materials, the program seeks to design and build a prototype that meets these requirements. If the program is successful in designing and testing a threshing machine that meets the requirements, the program seeks to kick-start local manufacturing and sale of the machines to other villages in Ethiopia. We have built up a good repore with the local population through starting one social entrepreneurship business and we are in the process of building a school. We have very recently also secured limited funding to improve agricultural production in Simbo, and see great opportunities for an affordable threshing machine to immediately reduce poverty and improve the lives of farmers in Simbo and throughout villages in Ethiopia.",1010091,Not Accepted,10091-12,The Lemelson Foundation,0017000001LSW9BAAX,a2C39000002zYtNEAU

The SSU Sustainable Vision Program will provide students with experience in real-life project management in conjunction with sustainable infrastructure design and will serve as a framework model in which projects of a similar nature may be conducted by both private industries and other universities.   In order to efficiently design a sustainable infrastructure project in an international and underprivileged community, socio-cultural issues must be researched and examined, ecological conditions tested and analyzed, the local resources and environment must be monitored and evaluated and included in the design, and international communication must be established. These determinants must be performed in a sequential process, relying upon interdisciplinary collaboration, achieving specific milestones, and proper preparation. To determine the success of the proposed program s model for innovative and sustainable design solutions for an underprivileged international community, a pilot project such as this must be performed and evaluated.",1010107,Not Accepted,10107-12,The Lemelson Foundation,0017000001LSW17AAH,a2C39000002zYtNEAU

We propose a three-year project to create a new course and modify existing courses to build on innovation and entrepreneurship and develop a distribution and marketing plan for a clean water system.   We propose to develop a new design course called,  International Projects.  This course will be offered in the sophomore or junior year of engineering.  This course will be modeled after the successful Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) program, expanded to an international focus. The International Projects course will be combined with existing courses in First Year Engineering design (in which the design of a poverty-alleviation design is required), Principles of Entrepreneurship and Extradisciplinary Seminar (a multidisciplinary course with the theme  Globalization ) to offer students the opportunity to fully develop and eventually implement solutions.  This will result in the creation of multidisciplinary teams of students working on a design for clean water distribution system, including a business plan for distribution for rural Dominican communities that works for the Dominican population and culture.
