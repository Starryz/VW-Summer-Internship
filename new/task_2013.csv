Travel is almost 50% but I’m assuming you will need to do some trips to establish partnerships/project work on the front end. And since you are forgoing the faculty stipend rather selflessly, I won’t argue.""

I look forward to seeing you back in DC at our annual conference March 24-25, 2017. Please bring some students too! And you can apply to have one of your stronger teams showcased at Open Minds which will be at the Smithsonian again. 

By the way, you may know that we are very involved with GIST (at the State Dept.) now, running bootcamps all around the world and hosting their website. You made the initial introduction - thank you.

1011186,"JKJ notes from conversation with PI: ""In response to the reviewer feedback: Absolutely a new program. We have a specific grad program started by nciia now self-sustaining. We do not have that at the undergrad level - currently undergrads work on projects handed to them by partners but they have no mechanism for implementation. No this is not incremental - it’s a new program to bring our undergrad design program to a new level - right now very limited in gh design. Sustainability plan - his honest response is that if he can show good results he’ll be able to sustain. Need one or two success stories we’ll be able to pull in funding - it’s a leap of faith. 80% of his energy is focused on getting to market. Might have been naive on the time it takes to get a product into clinical use. Day of Birth Alliance - 3 partner model. Innovation/student (Hopkins). Manufacturing partners - Laerdal Global Health or others JHPIEGO (needs assessment/on the ground and implementation support, distribution network and global/public health advocacy - to convince the govt. ) - giving feedback to early stage design project. (by the way the electronic partogram projectwill work with frog design / GE Foundation providing the funding for frog - another partner example) New partnership with medtronic and Boston Scientific (unrelated to global health - renal cancer). Once this model is proven other industry partners will get interested.""",Completed,Normal

1011205,"From Grants Analyst Johannah Varland: Dr. Chen has asked me to contact you regarding a change she would like to make to the approved budget. Over the course of the project, she has determined that the funds that were earmarked for stipends would be better used to supplement the budget for supplies and materials for the EWB Workshop and to develop the solar digital libraries. I wasn't sure if this was the type of change that would require approval by you, so I am sending this request just in case it would need written approval. Hi Johannah, 
Our reply: Thanks for getting in touch. I've cc'ed Patricia Boynton, who is now VentureWell's Grants Management Officer. Patricia  can assist you with this budget reallocation request. To start it would be helpful to get a sense of how much of the initial $10,000 award remains to date and exactly how much you're proposing to reallocate from stipends to materials and supplies. After we get this info, Patricia will follow up with any additional questions we might have. Response: To date, the expenses total ~$5950 and representing $550 in payroll and $5400 in supplies . The amount that we are proposing to move from stipends to supplies is $2500. The stipends were to help entice students to work on the projects, but instead, students want to volunteer their time to work on this particular project. The funds could then be used for building solar digital libraries. Dr. Chen would also like to transfer $1490 in wages to the supplies line item for the digital libraries and $300 to travel for the upcoming conference.  Changes approved by JKJ. New budget and reallocation approval letter attached below.
