Khanjan - Congrats on the additional funds and thanks for the additional info. The strong business/entrepreneurial background plus the telemedicine experience will no doubt be a huge benefit.
Enjoy your time in India - and hope you feel better soon. Talk to you in the New Year, Jennifer

Dear Phil and Jennifer,
 
I am really glad to know that NCIIA has decided to fund the Mashavu project. Thank you.
 
A quick follow up on two points which I was rambling on last night:
-          Best Application Scenarios/Best Business Models: Honestly, there are a very large number of application scenarios, business models and revenue models.  We are actually trying to capture them in a paper for IJSLE and  just presenting it is getting pretty complex. As I said yesterday, I don’t know yet which model is the best one. But I do have a LOT of information and a good understanding of the various trade-offs in the game and I am confident that we will be able to identify the best scenario/model (for early successes) as we move forward.
 
-          Business expertise on the team:  I forgot to mention:
o   Paul Maina, the Director of Children and Youth Empowerment Center in Kenya: We are working with him on Mashavu and the Eco-Village and WishVast projects as well. He is one of strongest champions I have ever met. He works non-stop and is always available on the phone to answer questions. Before championing CYEC for street children, he was a small business development consultant. Also, on the Eco-Village, I am working with a number of Kenyan industrialists and entrepreneurs who will be advising on Mashavu as well. So we may not have a very strong team on the Business side at Penn State (its all about the context) but we have a pretty strong network on the African side. The head doctor at the clinic in Tanzania is also a businessman himself and serves on the Tanzanian national chamber of commerce.
o   Kathryn Dansky, Associate professor of HHD at Penn State: She came onboard after a talk I gave at her church. I think Phil hit the nail on the head when he pointed out how the telemedicine space is littered with failures. Kathryn has assessed a number of telemedicine initiatives (primarily in the US over the last 10 years) from the clinical perspective and is very familiar with the challenges of telemedicine systems.
 
Also, on a related note, I got approval notice yesterday of a $16K grant (from Schreyer Institute of Teaching Excellence at penn State to support a grad student) for the assessment of the “Eplum model“ of student engagement ( focusing on internationalization, public scholarship and multidisciplinary teamwork outcomes) which we will be employing to engage students on the Mashavu project.
 
Happy Holidays!
 
Thanks Folks!

1005916,2009-01-20,Rachel Agoglia,"Results from December, 08 FC call: hi Pali, Thanks again to you, Jim and Jordan for your time on Friday; we are really looking forward to the launch of this grant. As requested, here's a quick summary of we're looking for by the end of January 09 - hope this is helpful. Please provide the following in writing: 1. A step-by-step process and updated timeline for rolling this program out, focusing on the development of the technical and the entrepreneurial activities. Please clarify when the assessment ends and when the entrepreneurial activities will begin. (Reviewers wanted to be sure that there will be time for actual venture development during the grant period.) 2. Articulate the criteria and process you will use to collect the market data and how the Villanova students will be actively involved in the assessment. What tools will you use to do this evaluation? Also, as per our conversation, please expand on the partners involved, how responsibilities will be divided and how the activities will be coordinated. 3. Describe how you will explain Villanova's IP policy to all the stakeholders involved and what that will mean for the students, grassroots entrepreneurs, SITMO and others. As mentioned on our call we'll move forward with official notification of the grant (with approved budget) and then the award letter (contract) starting in January. One final note - SAVE THE DATE: March 18th, 2009 is the workshop for all Sustainable Vision grantees. We'll be back in touch with more details and look forward to welcoming you in Washington, DC for our annual meeting March 19-21 http://www.nciia.org/conf09/index.html.

Thanks so much for funding our proposed project.  We just returned from Peru yesterday, where Carolina and the rest of us worked to get the prototype solar drip irrigation system upgraded and working.  A couple of photos are attached.  We installed a field monitoring system for soil moisture, air temperature, and wind.  We also arranged an alliance with a local solar installer who is interested in selling, installing, and maintaining the systems in the future.  I learned a lot about growing asparagus also. 

We look forward to seeing you at the March workshop.

We are writing a NSF proposal to develop a supply chain tool for developing villages which will function like a ""kit"" to start a business.

One answer to the self-sustaining question is our plan to have an equity interest in the village businesses.  This will not be very profitable, but will enable us to create a network of village businesses and help them communicate with each other.  The primary goal of GlobalResolve is to develop REPLICABLE business ventures, hence the goal to start another one.  We have a contact in a village in Uganda who wants to use banana waste for gel fuel.  He is traveling to our Ghana village in May to observe what we have done there and then we hope to visit him in Uganda later this year.  We have found faculty at ASU who are experts in supply chain development and recently met another Ghanaian at ASU who has a company that does ethnographic market research to ""observe consumers"" for new product introduction and we are talking with him about a partnership.  He is already working with local vendors in Ghana which is the ideal and obvious outlet for gel fuel sales.

So, to answer your question, we will know better about breakeven points and profits by summer when we have completed our initial study of supply chain economics and written the proposal.  A new faculty member in our department, Jennifer Bekki, is using some of her startup funds to pay for the grad students who are working on that, so it really is a matching funds contribution, which we value and nurture.  And the resulting NSF proposal is a further extension.

BTW, I noticed that several people are presenting at the March meeting.  Was there a call for papers that I missed?  Or, are these invited presentations?  Whichever it is, we would be happy to present next year and we could even coordinate a session on replication of business ventures in the villages- not that we are or will be experts, but we are very interested in learning what other people are doing.

Thanks for your continued interest and I look forward to talking with you more next month.  The chairman of the advisory board of GlobalResolve, Mark Kerrigan, who lives in Virginia will be attending with us and it would be good if we good get together for half an hour to talk together.

We have definitely thought about this aspect of the project and it is something that we will be actively looking into during our trip this summer.  Specifically we are looking into contacts with Educate Africa where more students are being trained on social entrepreneurship, and with local NGOs and individuals that have worked on similar businesses in Rwanda.  We are taking the approach of both looking for experienced and motivated partners in the area, and further training for Innocent.

Mashavu: Networked Health Solutions for the Developing World
(Check complete blog with photos at: www.mashavu.com/blog)
 
May 22:
Today we presented the Mashavu system to our first local client. No projector, no PowerPoint, no fancy equipment. We pitched a semesters worth of hard work in a crowded room with some chairs and two laptops to a local nun who is a certified nurse from Mweiga named Sister Purity who was accompanied by her partner Joseph, a community health worker who focuses on HIV/AIDS. Our two stakeholders arrived early in the morning to listen to our pitch...(read further on the blog…)
 
May 21
The Mashavu team was excited to take their first trip to the Children and Youth Empowerment Center (CYEC) today.  After months of preparation and anticipation, it was exhilarating to experience first hand what has been so frequently described to us.  We toured the carpentry building, dining hall, libaary and classrooms where respectful students rose from their seats to welcome us.  We made small talk, learned about the facility, and roamed around the gorgeous garden that expanded a few hundred yards past the football field in the rear of the CYEC.  After the tour, we at last met one of our main stakeholders of the Mashavu system, the CYEC resident nurse, Mary Simiyu.  It was a relief to finally tour the clinic where the initial phase of Mashavu is to be implemented.  Eight of the Mashavu team members were escorted by Abdala, a teacher at CYEC around the surrounding community to learn and interact with them.  She was very involved with the town's inhabitants and helped aid our group by suggesting who to talk to and initiating conversations in Swahili.
The health issues that were very evident throughout the town were a large part of the citizen's lives, and they often felt stuck in their individual situations.  However, this did not deter them from engaging us in friendly, informative conversations.  It was a very overwhelming and eye-opening experience, and we are looking forward to going back tomorrow.

1005947,2009-07-16,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Mike Callahan called yesterday to tell me that he is likely getting a job or going to grad school at U. of Oregon this fall and will make a decision by mid August. Sounded defeated, as they hadn't raised the $350k goal. Jacob (the other team member) is even less committed as he is graduating in Dec with double major AND working with another startup Panda Bikes (bamboo). They have a general manager (unpaid) in Peru and will likely take a trip down there in Aug. But they have minimal inventory and can only fulfill small orders. Strategy is to import in large quantities, but they need capital for that. He thinks partnering with a cell phone company that has a distribution network is the way to go.  Also, the plan to partner with Envirofit never happened, although they are willing to send them cookstoves (but shipping one cookstove to Peru costs $200).

He has not spent one penny of the SV grant funds; said he didn't feel right about it. They have about $6k left from CSU and bplan competitions. He is willing to return the NCIIA funds, ""pass them on"" to another grantee (he mentioned Lupita) or keep the grant and let another team of GSSE students run with it in the fall. Looking to us for an answer.

I think part of him is hoping for a miracle, as this is where his heart is and what he'd like to be doing, but he didn't sound optimistic.

I will follow up with Ken Petersen, the PI. My recommendation as of now is not to let them keep the funds for another CSU team, but I'd like to hear what Ken has to say. Thoughts?

How are you doing?  I have a lot of great news to share related to PowerMundo.  Can we schedule a conference call at your convenience?  
 
Here is a link to some photos from my recent trip.
http://picasaweb.google.com/mitchcallahan/PowerMundoPeruCantoGalloAug17#
 
During my last two week visit to Peru we received more orders than we did the entire previous summer. What's more our partners and staff in Peru are more aligned and working for sweat equity. In fact several staff from Practical Action (ITDG) are now working for PowerMundo. The kerosene ban in Peru has been a great advantage for us.  The head of the energy minister’s cabinet requested a quote for 100,000 solar units and GTZ discussed a pilot program for 10,000 solar units.  Also the government is coordinating a 500,000 cook stove program.
 
I demonstrated the Toughstuff solar lights to the government and GTZ (and many others) , but the customers we're not as interested in the Toughstuff product as others solar products.  There reaction illustrated to me that our business model is a better fit in this space since we aren't tied to one technology.  At the same time I realized that one company like Toughstuff could not take over our operations in Peru.  
Given these new circumstances, our team is implementing a successful strategy to overcome the gap in startup capital.  Rather than continuing to focus the majority of our efforts on fundraising in these challenging economic times, we are now focusing on sales and operations in Peru. An advantage of our business model is that we can begin operating with low initial capital.  We can use the available capital to purchase inventory and quickly turn inventory into revenue. 
 
While raising funds I received feedback that people wanted to see more sales before investing.   For example, Grassroots business fund put us on their watch list and indicated if we could demonstrate more sales they would invest.  Moreover, Michael Sonnefeldt has put me in direct contact with, David Russell director of the Grameen Foundation in the US.  If we focus on sales we will be earning revenue and attracting future investors.
 
I am recruiting students from the GSSE program at CSU and I continue to receive internship, volunteer, and employment inquires from college students around the US. 
 
Our goals are very much in line with the sustainable vision grant.
 
PowerMundo is:

Applying best in class breakthrough technologies to address basic human needs 
A commercially viable sustainable replicable business
Expanding curricula and in-the-field opportunities offered to students
Designed to be sustainable beyond the length of the grant
Providing a structure for ongoing collaboration and education by working with universities around the world.

 
Now that I am supporting myself financially and working on PowerMundo, I have a team of Peruvians helping me, education opportunities with universities, greater demand for products in Peru, and huge potential sales and human impact I am looking forward to moving forward with PowerMundo.    
 
At this point we have not spent any portion of the NCIIA grant to support our activities.  We want to continue the positive relationship between CSU and NCIIA and be good stewards of the generous grant funding.  Likewise we want to continue our open and honest dialog.  Give the new circumstances and conditions I would like to discuss if NCIIA is comfortable with PowerMundo proceeding with the NCIIA sustainable vision grant. Ken Petersen fully supports this plan.   

Ken and I look forward to speaking with you at your convenience.

everyone is working for free/sweat equity
starting with smaller inventory, ready to scale up if they win contracts
receiving small orders, sending samples
Oct 9 will recruit students from GSSE

2 products are bestsellers: Nova and Freeplay radio (all sold at 100% markup)
bootstrap so they are cash flow positive
use profit for addl marketing
would negotiate payment terms half up front from govt
GrassRoots Bus fund and Grameen want to see sales in the thousands before they consider funding.

Joseph asked about VWell...does he want to be considered - yes. Joseph offered to help him attract other funding. Has about 50k in kind.

1005947,2009-10-15,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Jennifer,
I appreciate your help with the web link. Also, thank you for reviewing our materials and for your questions.  
During our phone conversation I heard your concerns about how PowerMundo could overcome capital constraints.  Our bootstrapping approach is the best strategy to overcome this challenge.  We have reduced our expenses, reduced our capital requirements, increased our staff, strengthened our network, and are experiencing increased product demand.
To respond to each of your 5 question areas I have better explained our strategy in the paragraphs below. If you have any other questions I am happy to provide more information.
1. When preparing our income statement, I made the conservative assumption that we would not receive any additional capital during the first year. Our plan is to meet our sales goals without relying on any additional cash.  This spreadsheet demonstrates that PowerMundo can continue without any additional investment capital.  Regardless, we will continue to seek additional investment so we can reach economies of scale quicker. When we receive additional investment capital the financial picture just gets better than the one I have proposed.  
2. Our team drastically cut salaries to eliminate cash constraints caused by monthly personnel expenses.  The core management team is working for sweat equity. I plan to incentivize salespeople with a % commission.  Please note that the assumed salary expense is low by US standards, but the monthly minimum salary in Peru is $180 US / month.  Also note if or when we win the bid for the 100,000 unit purchase order that will be roughly $4,000,000 million dollars in sales without any salaries expense. (We’ll have more operating salaries at that point and the money to pay salaries).  PowerMundo is not a labor intensive company because we leverage existing networks.
 3. I continue to commit a substantial about of time to PowerMundo. For example, during the last weeks I work my day job till 5, exercise, and then work on PowerMundo till 10-11pm about 3 times per week. I usually work on one weekend day and take a day off. During my recent trip to Peru it was 12 hour plus days.  
Jacob has not graduated. He graduates in December. He will be helping to develop and manage our advisory board.  Additionally, we have two additional key managers on the team.  The sales manager in Peru is Oliver Marcelo, who has worked as the Energy Project Manager for Practical Action in Peru. His group just received an Ashden award for their work in Peru. His supervisor, Javier Coello has also been a great help to PowerMundo.  Javier recently met with Prince Charles and Al Gore to accept the Ashden award. See:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/science/newsid_6236000/6236722.stm
Rodrigo De La Rocha has an engineering degree, an MBA from Georgetown, banking experience and is managing fundraising and business development. He is also looking at the possibility to expand into Bolivia in a couple years. He is also helping investigate carbon credits for PowerMundo and partnerships with microfinance.  Last semester we had two CSU students help us. We have six other people helping us remotely with various tasks such as legal issues and grant writing.  What's more is that our sales network is increasing.  For example, Javier Salvdar with ProPeru is acting as our sales representative in Cuzco, and Jose Bernilla is our liaison with GTZ. Additionally we have many organizations who are helping us. At the moment we have sufficient support. 
4. Last year I submitted a PowerMundo narrative to Cornell University’s Center for Sustainable Global Enterprise.  We plan to continue to participate in publishing opportunities.  
5. We already have several exclusivity agreements.  With every supplier I have discussed exclusivity and co-branding.  Since I am dealing with multiple suppliers I am in a better negotiating position to achieve favorable terms. As you saw in the Barefoot power presentation, they are only requesting 20% payment prior to the order. They have terrific supplier credit terms, have offered PowerMundo exclusivity, and co-branding for Peru.  I can put you in touch with their CEO if it is helpful.  I just spoke with him a couple nights ago. 
In summary, PowerMundo has been very prudent over the last year to only spend funds if we felt we could be successful and earn a return on the investment.  The only basic change in our plan is that our staff is supporting ourselves with other income rather than startup capital.   We are excited to continue operating focusing on sales with a improved funding strategy.  
Moreover, our goals, mission and strategy are directly aligned with the Sustainable Vision Grant mission to:
·      Apply best in class breakthrough technologies to address basic human needs 

·      Be commercially viable sustainable replicable business beyond the length of the grant

·      Expand curricula and in-the-field opportunities for students

·      Provide a structure for ongoing collaboration and education by working with universities around the world.

Mike, 

Thanks again for your response to my request for more info. Here are a few questions for you on what you sent:

1. Unclear whether you are going to need additional capital because there are no CASH FLOWS. That would be really nice to see - or is it bootstrapping all the way? Can you meet these goals without additional funding or will you go back to funders who said they needed to see products sold in the thousands before consideration?

2. Seems rather unbelievable that  under $30k in salaries will produce almost $1 million in sales . . .

3. In general, how much time will you be able to devote to Powermundo during the next year with working, presumable, full-time or close to it. And the same question for Jacob - has he graduated from the MBA program or does he have more to go. And if he has graduated, what is Jacob doing? Who are the worker bees besides Mike, Julio and the GSSE students? Is that enough? Will salaries be paid from future sales?

4. Do you plan to document your experience for dissemination in a case study format/brief regardless of Powermundo's success?

5. Do you think vendors will agree to some exclusivity in the near future? This proprietary position, plus the knowledge you gain about best of breed products (what sells, for how much and what won't sell) would seem to be of value.

Thank you for speaking with Ken and I last Wednesday. I appreciate your time. It was a pleasure to share PowerMundo's successful news that I had noted in my Sept 23rd email below. Also thank you for listening to PowerMundo's bootstrapping strategy. This approach is a viable a solution to our fundraising challenge. 
 
To address your questions concerning budget, sales, and student involvement I have prepared several files with the requested additional information. I have briefly explained the files below.
 
In summary, assuming sales of 26,000 units in the first year the EBITA is approximately $165K without assuming any additional funding.  As I mentioned we could have much larger sales as indicated from the 100,000 units quote requested from the government. By  bootstrapping PowerMundo will generate enough revenue to sustain itself in the long term.  
 
We have reduced our undercapitalization risk by eliminating salaries, rent, debt, and many other expenses. We don't have any payments that we have to make and our expenses are directly related to our sales. Also, we can reduce undercapitalization risk by negotiating favorable payment terms. For example, by requesting 50% payment upfront we reduce cash flow problems because our COGS FOB china is approximately 50% of the retail price.
 
For example, we can purchase the companion solar radio/light FOB China from 10-15$/unit and sell the unit in Peru for $35.  By receiving $17.50/unit before delivery we have more than covered our FOB china cost.
 
For the moment, having additional samples and minimal inventory in Peru will greatly help us achieve larger sales orders.  Also using the $40,000+ of inkind services we can improve the efficiency of our operations. Once we achieve reasonable sales we will demonstrate the  sales numbers to the investors we have already been courting during the last months.  
 
Given all the positive circumstances in Peru and the advantages of our business model bootstrapping is a viable funding strategy to build a long lasting sustainable social enterprise.
 
I am happy to answer any more questions or provide more information on any area of our business.   I appreciate your help to support our shared goals.
 
Thank you,

After some discussion with Michael Callahan, Ken Petersen (PI) and Joseph (and Joseph privately), I recommend we allow them to move forward and spend the grant funds. Currently they have not spent any of the 45,800.00 and the grant will expire Aug. 2010.

Pros:

-Michael has renewed his commitment to Powermundo; there's no other reason he's doing this except that he wants to make it happen. He is willing to commit about 15-20 hrs/week on top of his current job. He has been (painfully) upfront throughout and has returned from Peru energized & optimistic.
-His bootstrapping model doesn't depend on addl funding in the near future (he believes he can get funding from ngos and others once he's proven he can sell thousands of products)
-he has increased his team and will involve GSSE students
-Ken Peterson (PI) is supportive, and has been on the phone calls
-almost the entire budget (revised- see attached) is for materials (he's positioning Powermundo as a re-seller)
-If this works in Peru, this solves the distribution dilemma many other grantees are trying to crack. It might be replicable.

Cons:
-the numbers are very ambitious - he seems to be able to sell a lot of product without paying much in salaries/spending much. 
-if Michael loses interest or can't continue with this, the project will likely die
-future funding, per Joseph, will be difficult. They don't have a PRODUCT per se, so there's nothing to own. Because it's a service model, if he can get some exclusivity with vendors down the road, this might help. Not a VWell contender given the BoP and service focus.
-this is no longer a student run project, although students will be involved

I'd like to get back to him today or tomorrow. Let me know if you have an opinion/questions. Thanks,  jkj

I explained where we were with the Powermundo grant; Ken spoke to Paul Hudnut last night so he was up-to-date. .

Ken's input:

He remains excited about the underlying idea. He is on the Board of Powermundo (a registered LLC in the US and SAC in Peru) and willing to give his time as an advisor and/or PI.
He's put a lot of time into Mike already and he was disappointed that Mike decided not to pursue this full-time. He does not know how to evaluate whether lack of time will be an issue for Mike or not. He described Mike as competitive, hardworking and doesn't want to be hamstrung by those who are not as committed. (Hence his reluctance in the past to share ownership with other students). 

Ken said that he is now in a strange position, as PI on a grant that has no real connection to CSU. He doesn't think that the incubator that Carl and he and others are developing there is in any position to offer Mike any kind of connection to CSU for several months at least. However, if we decide to release this as a grant, he would authorize CSU to write checks to Mike (he said he would do it in chunks, with deliverables). 

Ken thinks the loan idea makes more sense both from CSU perspective and to see whether Mike is receptive. If not, that's an easy way to end this discussion. THe downside to the loan is that  Ken is out of the loop and would not be the PI.

Ken suggests that we see what Mike thinks of the loan idea before we go down the road of looking for loan agreement etc. as that will quickly clarify Mike's level of engagement. Bottom line, he is encouraging of the loan idea, wants to maintain a good relationship with NCIIA for the long-term (ie not let us down) and he will remain involved with Powermundo moving forward.

Phil and I will talk with Carl Hammerdorfer tomorrow to get his perspective.  jkj

1) Does he have other $ how much and how will it be put to work for PowerMundo
2) What is the arrangement with Peru people and how will he manage it going to scale ? What $ and resources other than GSSE resources are available to Mike and Powermundo?
3) What is deal with the CSU GSSE team (equity etc.)
4) What is Jacob's plan? Carl offered to follow up with him -


Carl - thinks that they have figured out how to do this. He thinks it is a viable venture - sees Mike as tenacious and motivted.
Thanks that Mike has done a good job of vetting his partners.
They are starting the venture incubator to address the post graduation continuation of these projects to convert them into ventures.
18 months is not enough time to get the venture on its feet in most cases. FOr foreign studnets they have an issue with Visa - they can be a research scholar work intensively with entrepreneurs. They need to make choices about how to it work.

HE does not see PowerMundo coming into the incubator as Mike has graduated, but perhaps in an ex officio staus  it would make sense.
Jacob Castillo - nominally a partner in PowerMundo but it does not look like he will be involved.
Mike has applied for a student team with incoming cohort to work with there. Sticking point is how the equity is shared, this is not resolved yet.
Mike has some addl resources from B plan competitions that they won. He stated that they have worked out a plan a have $ (is that grant $ ?) They will know by 10/28 about the student team recruited.

We should ask him directly about how much $ he has.

Carl has a very direct relationship with Mike. He'd be glad to talk with him.

They are committed to developing the incubator and they see it as a nescesity. Regardless of PowerMundo outcoem they see the incubator
Expects to launch it in December Zubaida will be managing it. He has space and entrepreneurs to mentoring. He may be able to provide some $ for doing tech assessments. Talked with him about various possibilities of a loan, grant loan combo or of a grant that runs in part through the venture accelerator with funds being drawn against milestones (enable them to count that as $ in to the incubator).

He will talk with Mike & Jacob and get back to us soon with insights and for further discussion.

Thanks for your patience! We'd like to move forward with Michael regarding a loan discussion. Michael, please give Joseph a call to talk about how we would structure the loan. Given Michael is driving this and that you're no longer at CSU, I think it makes much more sense as a loan than as a grant.

1005871,2010-04-23,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Here are the complete answers:

1. It appears there is a model in which the post office (government) can charge for these notices - has this been tested? 

The Ghana post office intends to go through with a pilot to test this. I recall while I was in Ghana last year that we discussed which post offices might be most suitable for such a pilot. This needs to be driven locally since they are now discovering entrepreneurship (the postal service is not ""fast"" at innovating). I think it would be best for them to partner with a local company to see this through.

2. In other words, is there an entrepreneurial outcome here? 

It's a good chance to have an entrepreneurial outcome. If we can get a no cost extension, it will give us additional time for our local partner, AITI and a local technology firm like Dr. Quaynor's NCS to work out a pilot. One of the things that we under-estimated was the time it would take to train the postal workers on how this would work. The postal service management sees the benefits, but the day-to-day staff seem to enjoy their well-known routines (even though I think their mail sorting tasks are tedious and can be done much more efficiently).

3. You also say you will ""Hand off project to Ghana Post for real-life use, with assistance from local partners"" - is this going to happen or will the project not continue once you and your students move on?

This can happen. I estimate we need 4-6 more months and no extra money. One undergraduate student has moved on. The other one is very much still interested and I have given him some coding assignments. He will be around over the summer and we could possibly do one last trip to officially hand off the project in Ghana.

4. How did you settle on this project? Whose idea was it?

I gave the students in the engineering design class four examples of how mobile phones can help solve problems in Africa. I used some of the examples from the presentation I made last year in DC at the NCIIA conference for SV grantees. The project was pitched to the entire class and we got two students for our project. They looked at the examples and came up with the mail sorting idea. I had to add some input to make it implementable, and we refined it even further after our trip to Ghana last year in December. We discussed filing a provisional patent application through the school's tech transfer office, but that seems to have been a bit too much for the students to do in addition to all the code they wrote, so I'll see if I can get that done.

It's great to see students come up with new ideas. However, I have also seen that several undergraduate students like to follow instructions, and creativity is not for everyone. It took our two students a while to go from the examples provided to a practical idea (mail notification) and their classmates were making good progress on their projects that, in some cases, were upgrades to projects previously done at Thayer. Brainstorming can take time, and it seems to me that students prefer to have clear goals and a vision of the steps to achieve results in a term or two. I'm guessing some students like to know how ""hard"" a class will be when they think about signing up, and coming up with an idea seems to be a lot of hard work! Selling a long-term vision to some students can be hard, but it's not impossible.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

At some point, sooner than later, I will talk to you about the business model and how we may sustain the operation of the system already installed and the second one coming soon. The system is easy to run and the results are better than expected. However, we need to win over some existing NGOs and at the same time initiate a grass-root approach to persuade more consumers to participate and pay. I also intend to install one unit in Laos. I am trying to raise funds independently to create some momentum in southeast Asia. Yes, this is the last week of class. Can we talk next week?

Trust you are doing well.
 
I am writing about the Mashavu SV grant – #5881.
This is a request to spend funds (as outlined in the budget) without the proposed sub-contracts.
(essentially, the funds will be charged in lieu of appropriate receipts/appropriate letters as per PSU rules)
 
In the approved budget, we had two subcontracts with CYEC for $3300 each.
Last year, we did not do the sub-contract because we found other funds to cover some expenses while some other expenses (like workshops and meetings) simply did not happen due to time/logistic issues and because we were simply not ready for it and did not want to waste money unnecessarily.
 
We have actually incurred those expenses during this year and specifically during the Summer testing period.
Due to our bad experiences with sub-contracts with Kenyan organizations in the past (which I believe you are well aware off), I decided to not do a sub-contract with CYEC and instead pay them for (Exactly the same) expenses as they arise. That way we have control over the funds and are not at CYEC’s will.
 
Let me know if you need additional explanations/revisions to the budget.
To summarize, the only thing that has changed is that instead of doing a sub-contract and transferring the funds over, we spent the funds directly on those items.
 
Thanks!

Merci pour l'aide et les félicitations. The mobile banking will permit to clients of banks under prestatech portfolio to :
consult the balance of their accounts with sms
to transfer money from their account to another one with sms
to send request for checkbook or visa card with sms
to have in real time all movement in their accounts with sms
It's the first part of the project and we intend to pursue in a second part devoted to money transfer. Prestatech has an interesting client portfolio composed of seven banks in west Africa and the apps will be sold to them. We will percieve a percentage in the amount of the sale and got a maintenance contract with them. We intend to create a company but we hesitate between two formulas:
Doing it just at the end of this project or subcontracting and waiting for another year.
The first problem we face is that the economical environment is not favorable; you have to pay government taxes and other charges at the beginning so you must be solid. The second one is the financing; banks or financial institutions in Senegal have no financial plans for sartup particularly those working in IT. They are not used to and they are chilly to finance them. We are obliged to subcontract. Hope we will face.
The project started at 01 august, i have briefly informed Chrsitelle at this time but she was on holiday and we didn't have an occasion to talk more deeply about that. I will inform her. Mamadou

1005977,2010-11-16,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Jennifer-we discussed several approaches with the Bolivian team (they left just yesterday so we have a lot to process).
The Sumaj Huasi Foundation is the primary leader on the business effort, and established a MFE for fertilizer distribution resulting from the composting of human and animal waste. The Foundation has a broad reach to communities in Mexico, Brazil, Peru, and Chile. There are several sources of revenues ,including the sale of processed waste, diluted urine that serves as fertilizer, latrine construction, and the drilling of shallow wells to provide complete water and sanitation services. We are sorting through some new ideas that include increasing the capacity of the waste processing, and provision of a very rich organic material for non-food crop production. Marketing today is done through word of mouth through partner organizations, and via website.
 
We also evaluating the fee collection process for the collection of waste. Some waste streams provide revenues, others do not. Over the next few days we’ll be pooling our notes with the Emory team to firm up the plan and identify data gaps.
 
With regards to the Peepoo bags…I’m personally concerned about potential contamination issues related to cysts and pathogens that could be transferred to food crops. We’re collaborating with the CDC, so I’ll report back to you and see if we can find any test results for the performance of the bags in cyst and pathogen eradication.
 
The visits from the Bolivian team were productive and informative. We are working to help them devise standards, guidance documents, and best practices around sanitation that can be deployed with the Bolivian government.

Thanks for the interim report; sounds like you've made some good progress. Can I ask a follow up question on the MOU to handover the business to Manna Energy (IS that Evan Thomas who is now at PSU?)

1005879,2010-11-19,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Christina's response re where the team ends and Manna picks up: Hi Jennifer,

Great to hear from you! Thanks for reviewing the update.

Yes, Evan Thomas is with Manna Energy, who is now at PSU. I have cced him on this email, in case he would like to add anything to my comments below.

The stoves are being sold to Agahozo Shalom and Women for Women. The contracts are still being negotiated.

The project will become Manna Energy's project. They are a for-profit business. The reason we have decided to hand over the business to Manna is because they have the capacity to grow the business. Engineers Without Borders - CU does not have a continuous presence on the ground or paid staff to work and we have reached our capacity on the resources we can allocate to the project. However, Manna has been a strong partner throughout this project and has been allocating many of their resources towards the project for quite some time now. I do not have a good estimate on how big this could get in Rwanda but we believe that Manna has the resources to expand the business to its full potential.

The EWB-CU student team will no longer be working on the project. But Manna will continue to work with the students to ensure past projects are still being maintained and co-author any publications with EWB-CU. Additionally, I am still working closely with Manna on the stoves project.

I also just wanted to add that this handover was discussed during our first phone call in December of 2008 where a follow up during that discussion was the submission of Manna's Executive Summary.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

something we think is critical for success of the technology and the model we
have envisioned.  On this front, we just incorporated an entity in Lesotho in
December, in partnership with many of our colleagues there, so will be looking
to work with them on development of a local business plan during 2011.

We have a team of four previous/current MITers who make up the Board of the
nonprofit and are heavily involved with project organization and implementation
- you can see our short profiles on our website
(http://www.stginternational.org/team.html).  Matt is the acting President and
will continue to lead the project work as we move forward, though I am
retaining a large role in the engineering development of the control systems as
well.

Thank you again for the support NCIIA has given this project over the years - it
really has contributed to our program and ability to get this technology to the
takeoff point.  If there were any other details you felt were missing in our
final report, please do let us know - we are always excited to talk about our
project and progress.

Best,
Amy

1005881,2011-07-01,Leann Leake,"Email from Khanjan Mehta 6/27/11 (link has been added to Grant Documents below): Subject: Mashavu: One-Year Pilot Test!
 
Folks,
Here are some extremely exciting (final) updates from Kenya!
 
Mashavu: Networked Health Solutions
In collaboration with the United Nations Industrial Development Office (UNIDO), Ministry of Health, Children and Youth Empowerment Center (CYEC), we will be conducting a one-year pilot test of the Mashavu Telemedicine System. The pilot test incorporates two simultaneous kiosks running for a year. One Mashavu kiosk will be housed at the UNIDO energy kiosk at Oloisho-Oibor. A group of three trained kiosk operators (community healthcare workers) have been trained to operate the system. The renewable energy kiosk will provide the computer, electric power and internet access to operate the Mashavu telemedicine system.
 
The second kiosk will be a rotating kiosk that will provide services to five distinct communities around Nyeri: the villages of Gatitu, Micha, Ruring'u, Thunguma and Nyeri town (to reach the urban slum of Majengo). The kiosk will be held in each community for one day every week. A group of three CHWs have been selected and trained to operate the rotating kiosk. A dedicated (degree) nurse will provide feedback to all the patients with a response time of under 20 minutes. Community members in all six locations will pay a small fee to access Mashavu services. The CHWs operating the kiosk have an incentive-based model and will be expected to market the system and reach a goal of atleast 50 patients per week for both kiosks.
 
HESE and UNIDO will engage other partners and sponsors in raising these funds. Discussions are ongoing with the Global Peace Festival Foundation (GPFF) in Nairobi and other organizations to add a third kiosk for the one-year pilot. Discussions have been initiated with various stakeholders on potential scale-up strategies to reach more communities after the pilot test ends on June 30, 2012. Several organizations and corporations have shown interest in the system so far.
 
Mashavu is the combined work of over 250 students from ten colleges across Penn State. Steve Suffian and Jeff Lackey, the inaugural 2011 HESE Fellows spent the last five months in Kenya, and helped take Mashavu to the next level. We are very grateful to our current partners (mentioned earlier) and sponsors including the NCIIA, Merck, and several private donors.
 
We are now seeking $15,000 to support the pilot testing of the system. This includes expenses for the one-year pilot across six locations, systemic assessment and hosting workshops in Nairobi next Summer to develop the scale-up strategy. Please contact me if you would like to contribute funds towards Mashavu.
 
Essential Design: Solar Dryer (Final student blog post summing up their accomplishments and the next steps)
The end is here! It’s already been three weeks since we got to Kenya, and it’s quite unbelievable what we have done in that time. The first prototype taught us resilience – using locally available materials to replace some parts we had in mind, making use of glass pieces and wood shavers to mold the parts to our requirements and so on. The second prototype was made keeping all the lessons learned from the first one in mind and is now fully functional!

1005961,2011-07-15,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Hello Jennifer,
I was trying to gather all the information before responding to your inquiries. After installing another unit (fourth one in Cambodia), the number of people benefiting is expected to be around 750 but it can be expanded further through mobilization of individual communities. Also, we have to streamline transport of arsenic-safe water to villagers who live farther than 500 meters away. I plan to visit sites in Cambodia in October. The following recent award may be of significant help:

1005879,2011-09-12,Rachel Agoglia,"JKJ finally got a response from Christina:
Hi Jennifer, I did get your original email and I'm so sorry I never got back to you. It got lost in a bunch of other emails.

I'm actually in Rwanda right now working on a water treatment project with Manna and also on the stoves. On the stoves front everything is going really well. Manna has recently sold and installed 12 stoves at 4 different institutions. Additionally there is quite a bit of demand for the stoves with 4 pending projects. So what I am actually working on right now is creating and organizing all of the paperwork. There is a bit of bottleneck with the overhead of approving everything so I am trying to make this process easier. 

Innocent is working for Manna. He is a field technician and he works almost primarily on the stoves. Manna hired Innocent when the hand over happened.

The cost of the stove varies based on the size of the stove. A 4 liter stove costs about $150 while a 300 liter stove costs about $1500. See attached Manna brochure for more pricing information. Manna has worked out payment plans with clients. So a down payment is required but the client can pay for a period of 4 to 6 months after the stove has been installed, usually with the savings from the wood reduction.



Manna has interest for the stoves mostly from schools, large factories and restaurants. So beyond the schools there are additional institutions who want the stoves.



The best way to keep track of the project is through Manna’s website. The website is www.mannaenergy.com.



Again I apologize for not returning your email sooner. If you have further questions I would be happy to answer them.

1005871,2011-09-13,Emily Hodos,"Call with JKJ & Elsa on 9/13/11:
Elsa noted that while there was great tech innovation, lack of government relationships created road blocks to commercialization. A two-year time period, without having made government connections prior to the start of the grant, was not enough time to cultivate relations. In addition, unless students see a way to make money with the project following graduation, she sees that there is less motivation around the project living beyond their attendance at school. She also mentioned that students in this project were more motivated by grades than the success of the project.

Project could continue on if there were a faculty member to come forward with the interest and commitment.  Elsa is not in a position to do this.  There is a woman involved with the project in Ghana who is very interested in continuing with the project but can’t move forward without a partner in the States.

Else also mentioned that the Asst Dean of Tuck School is interested in working with students in Africa and working closely with students on Pico-Hydro project. She may be interested in seeing this along – but still can only happen if professor driven.

The other possibility of a future life would be if an NGO were to pick it up.

What would she do differently: 1) Be more involved as an advisor to students. Students were on own a bit more than she intended.

I can't really give a solid number on # of stoves per year but my best guess would be 2-4 institutions per month. Growth is expected but I can't really quantify at this time.

Yes the stoves are making a profit. The markup is about 100%.

The NYT piece resulted from the NCIIA meeting in DC, but we had not heard anything since and were surprised when it came out. I was contacted by authors working with McGraw-Hill on a water conservation book who saw the article, and am trying to find out more info on them. Bolivia did fizzle so we have a team in Chile now working with the Chilean government. Much easier working relationship than Bolivia where Evo Morales follows the Chavez-Venezuelan governance model. But we owe you a report soon, December I think, and it will describe the work there as well as the laboratory testing.
Gates Foundation announced $42 million going to sanitation research which to us represents a fundamental change in thinking about water and sanitation. They also put out a video very similar to the one we did for NCIIA in DC….

1005934,2012-01-04,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Justification:

We request a no cost extension of the funds for grant 7286-09.  This money will be used for prototyping of new products for the developing world for three courses in the GlobalResolve program:  EGR 494 - Design for the Developing World, OMT 494 - Global Impact  Entrepreneurship and ALT 494 - Village Energy Systems.  All of these courses were supposed to be taught in fall 2011, but there was a major change in department alignments and the faculty members who were supposed to teach them were allocated elsewhere at the last minute. These courses are being taught instead in Spring 2012 and will require funds to do prototyping.  The course descriptions are listed below.  Anticipated prototyping expenses include materials, mechanical fabrication labor, rapid prototyping, electrical fabrication and other methods for creating functional prototypes of new products to solve problems in the developing world.  GlobalResolve has a rich history of developing products including smokeless cooking fuel, efficient stoves, electrical generation (power generating pit toilet, twig light, foofoo generator), water purifier (Dewvap system), 3 HP oil-based diesel engine and other solutions over that past 6 years.  These courses make up a portion of the core courses for major in Technological Entrepreneurship and Management Concentration in Social Entrepreneurship, which is the new program and degree developed with the help of this NCIIA grant.

Design for Developing World (EGR 494/598)
This course is a workshop format in which you will design, produce and test new helpful product solutions for communities in developing countries.  Topics will include Human Centered Design. It will also include an overview of issues in the developing world, especially Africa; village life including income, politics, occupations, tribal and government structures; and personal stories that will help students understand the needs and how we can help meet them by designing useful and affordable products.

Global Impact Entrepreneurship  (OMT 494/594)
This project-based class is the third step in the GlobalResolve method after Understanding the Context and Designing Solutions.  This course concentrates on taking a technology and creating a viable business plan for sustainable economic development.  The course emphasizes the need for assessing the real needs of villager and to modify and adapt products that address problems and meet needs ultimately creating a village business around these product solutions.  The entrepreneurial theme of the course focuses on developing and applying sustainable entrepreneurship principles for developing nations.

Village Energy    (ALT 494)
[Description: Macintosh HD:Users:jtakamur:Desktop:GlobalResolve-Vision:GlobalResolve_Final_Logo2.pdf]This is a purely project course with only minimal lecturing, and primarily individual team mentoring from faculty who have worked in developing countries to help solve problems and who have a technical  background.  Teams will form and continue on a project all semester, ending with a working proof-of-concept prototype and exhibit.

Kenya and Ghana have been attracting significant attention from the aid organizations and foundations, and from what I understand the need for alternative sanitation methods is in greater demand in those countries than in Chile. The Chilean government has been trying to attract foreign entrepreneurs, and putting up seed funding appears to attract a wide range and large number of students. The Chile program was phenomenal. There is nothing like being surrounded by 300+ start-up companies, all in various stages of company development. The energy, ideas, creativity and success coming out of the program is astounding.

1005878,2012-07-06,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Update from Matt Orosz, President of STG intl - a nonprofit incorporated in the US and Lesotho.
This org. came out of an ET grant 4387-07 that subsequently split into 2 teams - Promethan Power and STG. STG then got a follow on SV grant which ended in 2010.

(JOSEPH - would grey ghost be interested in these folks?) They say their focus is ICT but they've funded energy. 

(in 2011 won a 100K Energy Prize from Conoco Phillips and 42,500 grant from Constellation Energy._
Matt just graduated; have been working on this for 4 years. He won an Echoing Green Fellowship for the next 2 yrs. 

Operating in Lesotho, with a demo project in sunny Florida at Eckhart (sP?) College and starting a research based pilot in India for other apps of the technology thru MIT. 

Heating a cooling is another need beyond lighting and powering equipment.

In Lesotho - Want to build a micro utility next to a system next to a clinic to provide electricity, heating and colling to the clinic and (with extra capacity) to others in surrounding area. They feel like the technology works/hase been tested, now they want to test business model/ and test a distribution system. Hopeing to put in 5 systems in Lesotho. Benefit to staff in Health ministry has a mandate to electrify schools and clinics. STG can show them that operating and maintenance costs for their system vs. other systems (diesel generator, PV for ex).is cheaper.  It's also not in the Ministry's best interest/expertise  to own and maintain systems - lack of maintenance usually kills the system within 6 months.  World Bank shows 40% of rural systems now fail/susceptible to theft. They need to finance that - they need to pay %50k upfront - need to figure out a loan or grant 

By buying from a utility (STG) in the rural areas like the Ministry currently is able to in the cities on behalf of their clinics, they don't have to deal with energy experts on their staff. 

Currently have a tech validation pilot that they installed for free for the Min. of Health. Also interest from Min. of Education. Believes they are receptive to moving in this direction. 
They hope their first client will be is the Min of Health and/or Education. They would agree via a contract to buy a certain amount of power over 5 yrs. Roughly $50k for a system for electricity, heating and cooling for a health clinic. Not asking for that up front. Would agree to pay a startup fee then a yearly fee which would cover $50k over 5 yrs. It would look similar but less than what they are paying for diesel. Plus they save on people/overhead and they're not on the hook when it fails.

However, STG would need the $50k or more upfront, so they are looking for funding from: 

USAID pending DIV
Global Environmental Fund
Acumen Fund  - started a conversation, will pitch in person. Want to see data from pilot system, demonstrate a team in place and a firm basis for a client.  Working on these 3 things this summer
Also other impact investors like E+Co, Invested Development
Bank loan options

Team right now - Amy Miller, Advisory role Brian and Eliz. and 2 interns and 2 engineers from goct of Lesotho and 4 technicians that they employ in Lesotho.
Ongoing collaboration/research with U of Liege in Belgium. 
There are 2-3 great hires waiting in the wings If they can pay them.

LONG term - 10 yrs + Want to eventually transfer the technology and train people to manage this in country by locals. STG  LEsotho is made up of the technicians and engineers they've been working with - have creating a partner org. in Lesotho also called STG.  No existing partner to do a handoff to - there is in India.

Hi Jennifer,

Thanks for reaching out! It's good to hear from you. That's weird that the email bounced. We've been updating our website so perhaps that was the case? I also noticed that the .com wasn't included in the email address on the forward below, but who knows. 

Feel free to give our new website a look over and provide feedback. www.staging.sanivation.com We haven't officially launched it yet so please dont circulate it widely yet, but do sign up for our newsletter to get future updates. 

In terms of impact you'll see that we are working on a variety of projects and providing thought leadership in the space. This fall we will be implementing over 30 toilets with UNHCR and CDC in Kakuma, i.e. one the largest refugee camps in the world. We are currently doing extensive pathogen testing on our technology. We are also taking a very human centered design approach and really working with community, conducting focus group discussions etc ensure solutions scale.

Inline image 1
We have another ongoing project in Naivasha, Kenya where we have paying customers for an in home toilet service. We are not as large as Sanergy (yet) so we dont have as specific metrics. We are still working to pin down the right business model to bring scalable sanitation solutions to peoples home (nobody has been able to do this and if done right would be one of the biggest public health innovations, next to the flush toilet:) ). 

We definitely dont see Sanergy as competitor or any other sanitation group in the space. We are all working together. Re.Source from Stanford/Haiti just sent us one of their toilets to test in Kenya. I think I mentioned this when I was at your office but there is soo much market, 2.6 billion people dont have access to sanitation. The more we can learn form each other and collaborate the better off we'll all be. One thing we have been able to do is really cultivate a variety of relationships in the sanitation space. We are actually about to start a big push for technology review in the space (similar to what MIT is working on with USAID). I will say Sanergy has had great luck with funding and it would be nice to have the amount of resources they have, but overall they have been great mentors for us!

Feel free to reach out to Emily, Hana, or I with more questions and definitely let us know of any opportunities you aware of. I'm glad you are keeping in touch with all the NCIIA groups. It would be cool to have some sort of portal where we could all touch base!

The plans for the next year are completely up in the air.

We have had a very stable model for 2 years now –making $90 every month. We know exactly how to replicate operations.
The health ministry and JHPIEGO really want to work with us to replicate the model in other towns.

There are two problems:
The dust still hasn't settled on the province to county transition. So, we don't know who the local health officers will be going forward. The current officers are in ""wait"" mode since they don't know where they will be next.
After the Westgate attack, we are also nervous of risk management issues with having students and fellows in Kenya. I am going to Kenya in Dec to research the next set of stories and look over operations but will not be taking any students. Although we don't need to be there to sustain operations, 1-2 people from our team need to be there to grow the venture. The next set of fellows will be going to Cameroon (instead of Kenya) to work with Jola Ventures on our greenhouses there. That project is moving together very quickly. Construction has already started and we will be moving from the NDA to signing a contract with them within the next week.
We are moving forward with our low-cost Mashavu biomedical devices. Specifically, we are working on inkjet-printed UTI test strips for pregnant women and methanol detector for the local moonshine.  The devices are completely focused of helping our MHWs expand their scope of operations and enhance their livelihoods further. I was at JHU/JHPIEGO three weeks back for 2 days. It was fun interacting with Soumya's teams and I did a talk at JHPIEGO on business models for CHWs which was very well-received.

1005977,2014-08-28,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"From Joseph S: Sanivation is an outgrowth of a project we funded at George Tech ... called ... Solar Sanitation ... something or other!

Had a call with Andrew Foote from Kenya this morning.

Sort of like Sanergy.

Just finished a trial ... 32 toilets in a refuge camp. Kakama refuge camp. 160 refugees on the Sudanese border. His colleague will be at SoCap. Is planning to connect with Tricia.

Waste is turned into usable briquettes, with 2/3 agricultural waste!

In talks with UNHCR who are in desperate need for sanitation solutions. 

Sanergy has a toilet franchise model--community toilet. Costs about $400 via a franchise model.

In Sanivation's case, it's a portable toilet in their house rented monthly OR it's their refugee camp model.

In addition to their refuge camp trial, they have just started the rental model in peri-urban Nairobi.

They know the Sanergy folks and spend a lot of time together.

One of Andrew's co-workers, Ben, will be at SoCap. Benjamin Kramer-Roach. I will connect to Janine and to JT. Wants to talk with Lemelson.

They are getting legal support from the International Senior Lawyers project

I gave them some additional mentoring around board development and for-profit / non-profit issues.
