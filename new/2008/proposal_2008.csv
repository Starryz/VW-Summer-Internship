With a 5,000% subscriber growth rate between 1998 and 2003, the phenomenal mobile expansion has already led to a number of unforeseen, unorthodox uses of phones. However, even amidst the excitement of this expansion, there remains a dearth of second-tier growth in the mobile industry   specifically, the development of services leveraging the infrastructure deployed across the continent for socio-economic good.      The multi-disciplinary approach to engineering education is nascent in the developing world, where there is a lack of cross-talk between engineering disciplines, let alone consideration of entrepreneurship. What is needed is a skill-mixing partnership: an exchange of core competencies via a collaborative effort between multi-disciplinary, well resourced Western engineering students and bright, innovative African technologists. The mobile phone provides an excellent anvil for forging such a partnership due to the typically short product development cycle, low startup costs and the nascent nature of the field.       The sustainable vision conveyed in this proposal leverages the current underutilization of mobile phones by building bottoms-up applications based on existing user behavior, and in turn generating new ventures by student founders. The initiative will act as a conveyor belt for innovative mobile applications for socio-economic development.

Many amputations occur because of the Vietnam War, diabetic infections, peripheral vascular occlusive diseases, diseases of the limb, and trauma. Most of the amputees are on crutches or dragged by others on roller seats. After the limb has been permanently removed, a person s quality of life is seriously altered because the mobility is no longer the same as before. Prosthetic limbs were invented to restore the limb to ultimately bring the mobility level closer to that before amputation. Due to excessive cost of the prosthetic devices, most of the people living in the third world countries could not afford to have prosthetic limbs. This proposal provides the structure of a new pre-made VR Universal Socket (VRUS) prosthetic design that is affordable by low income patients. The objectives of this proposal include:       Design, build and test the prototype of VRUS for the lower extremity amputees in the third world countries.

For those living in deeply rural or mountainous locations, Diesel generator sets, while inexpensive up-front, require costly fuel; photovoltaic panels have a high up-front cost and high risk of theft.  Our solar thermal technology, by lowering costs relative to these alternatives, can facilitate distributed electricity provision, which results in increased economic opportunity, extended waking hours for study and leisure, time saved from chores, and improved services from the business, heath and education sectors.  This directly translates into an overall reduction in poverty, better living conditions at rural institutions, and improved quality of life, while stimulating the local economy and providing jobs.  Indirectly, by generating power renewably, the proposed electrification scheme contributes to lowering the risks related to climate change and decreases brushwood collection and land degradation.  By using a technology transfer approach and supporting local business development, we aim to provide a sustainable, renewable, and affordable energy option for rural locations.

Building on our research experience in aerodynamics, we aim to simplify the VAWT design to several modular components that can easily be manufactured, constructed and deployed in developing nations. The specific objectives of the proposed project are:      1. To use state-of-the-art computational tools (aerodynamics, aero-elastic tailoring and dynamics simulators) as well as experimental methods (wind tunnel models) to design and prototype an efficient, robust, low-cost vertical axis wind turbine unit to generate shaft power.       2. Have undergraduate engineering students, as part of capstone projects design and prototype shaft-power devices to directly generate business opportunities for the end user (water condensers, water pumps, air compressors, electric generators, etc.). The constraints of reliability, efficiency, simplicity and extreme environments will present relevant hands-on service learning design projects to engineering students (at MIT and UML).        3. Examine, develop and test a business model for subsidized deployment of these devices in Sub-Saharan Africa. The model will include cost subsidies for developing nations based on unit sales of systems that generate electricity and condense water.

Harvesting of wood and charcoal for cooking leads to severe deforestation in some places.  Industrial fuels such as propane or alcohol are available to some, but at great expense.  The key to reduced fuel usage is the heat transfer efficiency to the pot, and recent studies have shown that it is possible to double the heat transfer efficiency (Reference my work available on the internet???).  High efficiency pots are being made commercially for campers and backpackers that double the heat transfer, but these pots are too small and expensive (cost is about $50) for use in developing world situations.      The goal of this project would be to develop one or more designs for inexpensive pots that would at least double the heat transfer efficiency under typical cooking conditions.  The pot would be able to be made commercially at a reasonable cost, perhaps $5 more than an ordinary pot.        Specific objectives might be:      1.

To sustain the world in the future, 60% of the extra food required must come from irrigated agriculture and developing countries hold 75% of the world s irrigated area (FAO, 1999), where rural small farmers cultivate more than half of this agricultural land and 80% lacks electricity services (World Bank, 2000).  The world s food security relies on improving irrigation techniques for smallholder agriculture in developing countries. The common irrigation practice is flooding with seasonal water, gravity fed systems, or diesel/gasoline powered pumps. Solar pumps are clean, efficient and have lower maintenance. Drip irrigation (DI) is 40% more efficient than furrow and takes better advantage of solar and wind pumping because of its low pressure-low flow features (Burt & Styles, 1999).  Depending on the crop cycle, DI could allow four harvests per year instead of one in the rainy season, generating enough income to pay for the system. This work would be sustained as part of a ten-year-old program with indigenous Peruvian farmers.  Objectives:     Provide Peruvian small farmers, renewable energy (RE) entrepreneurs and engineers with the ability to design, install, and transfer RE DI technology..

One objective was to develop cellphone-based applications to link small-scale farmers and other entrepreneurs with markets and enable them to utilize, strengthen and expand their networks. The study illustrated practical connections between social networks and cell phones in creating sustainable cooperative business models, providing market information and identifying entrepreneurial champions in developing communities. The study revealed that business relationships were based very strongly on trust and respect.      A symbiotic relationship exists between social and economic capitals. Social capital arises from the existence of trust in a society which, in turn, encourages cooperation in the generation of economic capital. In developing countries, most successful groups are based on trust and business cooperatives often fail due to mistrust and lack of transparency. Trust also plays a critical role in the diffusion of innovation because people prefer receiving information from trusted sources.      Program objectives:      1.

Remediation of petroleum-polluted environments is costly and technically difficult. Biosurfactants are microbially produced compounds with detergent and emulsification capabilities that can facilitate remediation by rendering such pollutants amenable to in situ biodegradation. Although similar to synthetic surfactants, biosurfactants are less toxic, and more biodegradable than synthetics, both attractive qualities for in situ remediation. This project will test biosurfactants and the microorganisms that produce them in scalable microcosms containing sediments and sands contaminated with a standard pollutant (weathered Alaska North Slope crude oil).      Established, environmentally friendly technologies such as microbially enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) also use microorganisms that produce biosurfactants in situ to recover petroleum from low-grade deposits within shale and sand. Recent advances in MEOR as well as higher demand for petroleum have made these technologies economically attractive. This project will test novel biosurfactants in microcosm test systems to validate success of MEOR technologies in sand and sediment matrices.       This project combines the experience of Peking University College of Engineering team-members with complementary expertise from the University of West Florida Center for Environmental Diagnostics and Bioremediation to develop technologies that address these global problems.

The equipment and training required for start-up would cost the borrower several hundred dollars (financed by Yehu Microfinance Trust) which could be repaid rapidly with the 400% projected increase in daily income generated by the use of this system.  NCIIA s $50,000 sustainable vision grant would catalyze the growth of this microfranchise initiative by financing the production and distribution of the first 40 coconut press microfranchises.  These funds would accelerate CCF s ability to begin to assist the estimated 20 million unemployed rural Kenyans to start these innovative and sustainable new ventures.
