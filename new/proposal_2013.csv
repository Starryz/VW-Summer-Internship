One country with such challenges is Colombia. Art Center College of Designs Safe Agua Colombia program works with families living in Colombias impoverished communities to design and develop solutions  products, systems, and services  around water, to help overcome the cycle of poverty. Working in partnership with regional NGOs, Compartamos Con Colombia and Socialab, the program aims to:

(1) Co-create, with end users, radically affordable products and systems with sustainable, scalable, real-world implementation;
(2) Address specific problems, with both quantitative benefits (illness reduction, water conservation, opportunities to generate income, etc.) and qualitative impacts (sense of dignity, quality of life)

Safe Agua Colombia is a sequel to successful prior Safe Agua efforts in Chile and Peru. But it includes two major programmatic advancements that elevate the work to a new level:

--The course will devise new systems as well as new products. Regional partners in Colombia are well situated to advise on developing and implementing systemic solutions.

--The course will serve as a feeder into the newly established Innovation Accelerator program (aka The Design Accelerator), an interdisciplinary incubator that is an exciting collaboration between Art Center College of Design, California Institute of Technology, Idealab, and the Pasadena Angels Investment Group. Student teams from Safe Agua Colombia will have a chance to compete for a slot in the Accelerator, which provides intensive entrepreneurship mentoring and an opportunity to pitch startup ideas to investors.",1011077,Funded,11077-13,a2C39000002zYt4EAE,0017000001LSVqsAAH

The project objectives are listed below: 
1. Take advantage of the diversity of views and knowledge in different countries by creating a joint multi-national 2-course capstone sequence in innovative solution creation and entrepreneurship. 
2. Initiate and institutionalize a culture of globally-distributed collaboration around innovation and entrepreneurship that will promote the creation of E-teams comprising university students and faculty from both ASU and UTT. These E- teams will in-turn ideate, create, demonstrate, and bring to market, innovative products and solutions. 
3. Strengthen E-Teaming experiences for geographically-distributed design teams who are not able to travel to meet each other in person, or physically connect with stakeholders, mentors and entrepreneurship coaches. Develop and evaluate reusable curricular and technological tools, strategies and guidelines that provide a platform for a truly virtual immersion and venture creation experience.",1011111,Not Accepted,11111-13,a2C39000002zYt4EAE,0017000001LSVtoAAH

Ugandan Students Exploring Agri-business Entrepreneurship,50000,Ugandan Students Exploring Agri-business Entrepreneurship,Colorado State University,NA,11/7/13,11/8/13,NA,NA,Sustainable Vision,"This project will engage Ugandan agriculture students from Makerere University in entrepreneurship through technical and economic feasibility evaluation of cyanobacterial bio-fertilizer produced at the village-scale. Our objectives are to:
1.	Provide a multi-disciplinary Ugandan graduate student team with entrepreneurship training in technical and economic feasibility evaluation
o	Technical Evaluation
     &#61607;	Optimize the pond design for production of cyanobacterial bio-fertilizer in Uganda 
     &#61607;	Determine the yield impact of cyanobacterial bio-fertilizer 
o	Economic Feasibility
     &#61607;	Evaluate the economic feasibility of cyanobacterial bio-fertilizer production in different farming systems of Uganda
     &#61607;	Analyze the market chain for cyanobacterial bio-fertilizer as a commercial enterprise in Uganda
2.	Develop strategies for future scale-up of technology and dissemination through Ugandan entrepreneurs

Soil fertility depletion in smallholder farms is the fundamental cause for declining per capita food production in sub-Saharan Africa.  The price of fertilizers in Africa is at least twice the international price, and <1% of Ugandan farmers use fertilizer.  Thus, there is great need for alternative, locally-produced biological fertilizers in Ugandan farming systems.  With this funding, we will develop a student team to test the feasibility of producing cyanobacterial bio-fertilizer for a reliable, local source of bio-fertilizer in Uganda.  Our competitive advantage is that farmers can grow cyanobacterial bio-fertilizer at the village-level using their poorest quality land, energy from the Sun, a small investment in the on-farm production system, and a small amount of labor, and can use it on their own fields to increase crop yields or sell it to neighboring farmers to increase income.

Summer Grand Challenge Program,50000,Summer Grand Challenge Program,Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology,NA,11/7/13,11/8/13,NA,NA,Sustainable Vision,"The Summer Grand Challenge Program is a multidisciplinary two year project in which undergraduate students design and build an inexpensive and locally manufacturable system that utilizes solar energy to help improve the living conditions of people in underdeveloped countries such as Kenya.  The program is unique in that it is co-taught by three professors from different fieldsin this case, physics, engineering, and humanitieswith the goal of providing experiential learning opportunity for students.  After an intensive problem definition phase, students will determine the target location and needs of the local customer in collaboration with a student from Egerton University, which will influence the final products functionality.  At the end of year one, the faculty will travel with student teams to the target location in order to implement and test the product developed.  During year two, performance improvements to the prototype will be made based on end-user feedback as well as improving manufacturabilty by minimizing part count, decreasing cost, and reducing build-time. Thus, the main goals of the program are:
	Generate a functioning device utilizing basic engineering concepts to help less developed nations
	Provide students with a globally-focused entrepreneurial experience as part of their undergraduate education
	Continue to strengthen collaboration between Egerton University in Kenya and Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology

Development of a Low-cost Multi-axis Prosthetic Ankle for Underdeveloped Countries,41461,Development of a Low-cost Multi-axis Prosthetic Ankle for Underdeveloped Countries,The University of Texas at El Paso,NA,11/7/13,11/8/13,NA,NA,Sustainable Vision,"Amputation, whether resulting from vascular disease, diabetes, or trauma, usually affects many facets of life, including mobility, activities of daily living, educational attainment, employment, and social life. Problems associated with amputations are more intensified in the developing countries, due to cultural specificities, under-developed infrastructure systems, and lack of funds. In addition, prosthetic feet currently available in developing countries fail to reproduce the motion of a natural ankle-foot system. Since patients often walk on uneven ground and unpaved roads, the prosthetic components need to replicate the large range of motion allowed by a natural ankle joint. The proposed project will be conducted in close collaboration between UTEP and LIMBS International, and will focus on the development of a low-cost, low maintenance, locally repairable, and adjustable multi-axis prosthetic ankle joint for the underdeveloped countries and underdeveloped sub-regions of this hemisphere. The field study will be conducted in Mexico because, although classified as a developing country, the issues of rural regions are similar to the ones found in underdeveloped countries. In addition, its proximity to El Paso will allow student to travel more frequently and therefore gain valuable international experience. In addition, since many of our students are fluent in Spanish, field assessment will not be inhibited from any language barrier. This project will provide students with hands-on experience on product development while bringing much needed prosthetic technology to amputees all over the world.",1011171,Not Accepted,11171-13,a2C39000002zYt4EAE,0017000001LSVqgAAH

These characteristics make these problems suited for applying environmental entrepreneurial approaches. In natural resource projects, such as lake or stream restoration, entrepreneurs could be aided through access to better information capital.  This project will address environmental entrepreneurism and the generation of information capital by creating two courses that fit into Portland States general education program. These courses can be counted as part of the degree requirements for any major.  The two courses will be: 
	a Junior Cluster course that focuses on environmental entrepreneurism for the common good.  It will compliment courses taught by School of Business faculty on social entrepreneurism. 
	a community-based service-learning Senior Capstone 

In the Capstone a team of students do three major activities: 
	learn about natural resource entrepreneurism from ongoing projects in the Klamath Basin, Oregon, 
	undertake a lake restoration pilot project that will contribute to lake restoration and will be instrumented to provide real-time data on lake health parameters, and 
	create a web-based portal that targets environmental entrepreneurs who want to engage in small scale lake restoration efforts.  

These proposed courses and activities are all part of an effort to further the collaboration between Environmental Sciences and Management and the School of Business at Portland State, the Department of Natural Sciences at Oregon Institute of Technology and several community partners.
