NGOs and other organizations have attempted to address this problem, but their methods have not been sustainable. We are proposing a potentially global solution to the problem using a new, simplified eyewear design and a business model that will enable local people to provide services to their community members. Project Objectives:   Develop a new frame design and set of lenses that can be manufactured inexpensively. This new design will cost $2 or less, enabling a price point affordable by nearly everyone.   Develop a business model focusing on the local community, comprising manufacturing, marketing, distribution, and service after the sale (including repair). The project team will involve local people significantly in every phase of the project to assure its appropriateness for local conditions.   Implement the eyewear design and business model at one location in the developing world. The project team will educate and train local people to take over the process in its entirety, and locally available materials will be used whenever possible, thereby having positive social, economic, and environmental impacts.

Among these, is a lack of basic equipment to preserve and protect newborns, particularly at-risk neonates. For example, a simple incubator/warmer is lacking in most primary health care facilities. Furthermore, available solutions pioneered by developed countries do not fare well in a resource limited area- for example, reliable electricity supply is not readily available. Cultural factors also inhibit care giving, as there is social pressure on mothers to get back to work as soon as possible and leaving the infant in a hospital is generally not done, thereby further decreasing chances of survival.    Considering all these complex technical and social factors, our team from the UMBC in partnership with General Electric s Maternal Infant Care division propose to pilot simple, rugged technology solutions that can be readily implemented in a low resource setting. Our one year goal is to design and test a low-cost incubator-warmer-cooler-transporter. We have teamed with a charitable hospital in Southern India (Chandrakala Hospital, Mysore) as a potential initial deployment site from where we will develop a more detailed understanding of the local environment and social and cultural practices to enable successful adoption of our technical solution.

Participating families pay a tariff for arsenic-safe water; there are clear signs of economic growth and enhanced employment opportunities. A polymer-based arsenic-selective adsorbent forms the core of the technology and is currently manufactured in the United States. High cost, import duty and uncertainty in shipping due to bureaucratic formalities in receiving countries have surfaced as primary obstacles for further growth.

The goal of this project is to prototype and commercialize a polymer-based extremely-low cost solar heat water pasteurizer for the rural Nigerian market in Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Ondo, Ekiti and Oshun States. The Nigerian National Population and Commission s 2008 Demographic and Health Survey shows that 85% of the rural population is not treating their water in any way prior to drinking even though only 43.6% of the rural population has access to safe water.  Many in both rural and urban areas boil water from rain and contaminated ponds. This method has several well-known drawbacks. However, all microbes that cause disease in humans do not survive at temperatures exceeding 65oC, which passive solar water pasteurization (SWP) devices can produce. Initial work has already shown a flow-through SWP capable of producing 15L per day would be less expensive than current water supply methods if it can be fabricated with a polymer heat exchanger. Such heat exchangers have already been tested by DIC. To continue this work, this project has 3 goals:   * Develop, test, and refine the complete solar water pasteurization prototypes to obtain 30L/day (MTU), with DIC providing technical support and AEPAY Nigeria providing market information, social acceptability and manufacturability guidance.    * Successfully field test the prototypes in south-western Nigeria (MTU & AEPAY)   * Begin manufacturing and selling the solar pasteurizers in Nigeria (AEPAY).",1008962,Invited Resubmit,8962-11,0017000001LSVnYAAX,a2C39000002zYtIEAU,01239000000Ap02AAC,The Lemelson Foundation

There is broad agreement on the need to help small-scale farmers move from subsistence to sustainability by boosting their agricultural productivity, reducing spoilage and providing market linkages. Greenhouses allow farmers to grow vegetables and fruits year-round through mechanically controlled temperature and irrigation systems. Greenhouses can help farmers increase their yields and improve their livelihoods while reducing spoilage and furthering food security. Imported greenhouses sold in East Africa are designed for large commercial farms. They are too expensive for small-scale farmers and do not meet their needs and use preferences. Over the last three years, our team has collaborated with diverse Kenyan and Tanzanian entities to design, prototype, and field-test affordable greenhouses designed for small agro-enterprises and sustenance farmers.

A significant increase in yam flour production can improve food security, develop sustainable agriculture and improve local economies. Small enterprise flour production would be an innovation which would benefit farmers and local producers because large amounts of lesser quality yams spoil. Three organizations propose to collaborate with Ghanaian communities to introduce robust manual post-harvesting equipment with a locally appropriate business model and production scale. University of St. Thomas students in geography, business, and engineering will work together with members of the Farmer Training Centre in Bolgatanga Ghana, a non-governmental organization committed to ensuring sustainable livelihood and food security in Northern Ghana, and with the Department of Agricultural Economics and Extension at the University for Development Studies in Tamale, Ghana, that seeks to promote agriculture-based micro-enterprises. Primary objectives of the proposal:      UST geography students will map local yam production capacity and service areas, while  business students identify current value chain and market pricing, establish target retail price points, and develop a community-based business model.        UST Engineering students will examine optimal processing alternatives and develop, improve, and test yam processing equipment.       FTC and UDS personnel will plan to scale and disseminate the basic technology for non-cereal flour production.

Enhancing Technology Competence of Historically Disadvantaged Entrepreneurs in South Africa (ETCE),48500,Enhancing Technology Competence of Historically Disadvantaged Entrepreneurs in South Africa (ETCE),Oklahoma State University-Main Campus, ,2011-10-13,2011-10-14, , ,"Oklahoma State University annually manages the Entrepreneurship Empowerment in South Africa (EESA) Program in poverty-stricken townships surrounding Cape Town, South Africa.  The program employs a creative approach to supporting survival and growth of ventures owned by historically disadvantaged entrepreneurs. We strive to make these ventures sustainable through hands-on consulting engagements by motivated, talented students, backed by a team of faculty members. A unique set of tools, models, cases and conceptual approaches have been developed to support the engagements. Twenty-five U.S. students join fifteen South African students for six weeks in working intensely with these entrepreneurs. Many of these entrepreneurs are involved in businesses that sell undifferentiated products or services, with low market entry barriers, where competition is intense, markets are relatively saturated, and price is often the basis for competing. Sixteen entrepreneurs are carefully selected based on interviews conducted with a pool of seventy ventures.  A notable skill gap among these entrepreneurs, and one that is especially vital for the sustainability of these ventures, is technological literacy and technology integration. Support is requested in the form of a three-year grant to enhance the EESA Program with an innovative, structured and systematic approach to improving technological literacy among these entrepreneurs, and integrating technology into their ventures. The initiative includes four major components and a tracking system to monitor technology integration.",1008993,Not Accepted,8993-11,0017000001MBMR1AAP,a2C39000002zYtIEAU,01239000000Ap02AAC,The Lemelson Foundation
Sustainable Clean Water System,48458,Sustainable Clean Water System,Santa Clara University, ,2011-10-13,2011-10-17, , ,"A water purification system is proposed for delivering clean drinking water. The system takes in seawater and distills it into fresh drinking water. This system will be new, sustainable and designed based on an affordable technology. The proposed system will provide long-term, low-cost high quality drinking water to augment available resources in urban communities or to other communities whom otherwise do not have access to clean water. This system will also be portable, scalable, low maintenance and environmentally friendly since it will be designed to run fully on solar power. With no external electrical power input, the system can be located in remote regions around the globe where electrical power might be expensive or not available at all. Phase I (year one) of the project will utilize off the shelf components for testing and verifications. Individual components will be redesigned and optimized during phase II (year two) of this project. The estimated cost for fully assembled system will not exceed $6,500 and will fit into a standard 20-foot shipping container for ease of transportation worldwide. We believe the final product of the proposed system will provide an economically sustainable model due to the fact that future water demand is predicted to increase while current resources are continuously depleted. The objectives can be summarized as follows:    Design a standalone off-the grid water purification system.    The target system capacity for phase I is 1000 liters per day, phase I.    Market and commercialize an optimized system for worldwide adoption, phase II   ",1008994,Invited Resubmit,8994-11,0017000001LSW9fAAH,a2C39000002zYtIEAU,01239000000Ap02AAC,The Lemelson Foundation
"Proving Sustainability: In-situ instrumented performance and usage monitoring of water provisioning, treatment and sanitation technologies",50000,"Proving Sustainability: In-situ instrumented performance and usage monitoring of water provisioning, treatment and sanitation technologies",Portland State University, ,2011-10-14,2011-10-17, , ,"Nearly a billion people in the world lack access to safe drinking water, two billion have inadequate sanitation facilities, three billion use biomass for their daily energy needs and nearly half the world s population live in rural isolation, lacking access to the most basic human services. Meanwhile, the majority of international development agencies are responsible for self-reporting project outcomes. At best, expert spot-checks are conducted in the field occasionally. These results tend to show individual project success, while meta-surveys indicate on-going challenges in the sector.       This disconnect may be addressed through independent data monitoring technologies that provide objective data on system performance and use and can be used to demonstrate success and identify project weaknesses.       The Portland State University SWEETSense  technology can provide objective, qualitative and continuous operational data on the usage and performance of programs across a range of sectors and communities. The data is then directly integrated into SWEETData , an internet database presenting summary statistics on performance and usage of the monitored technologies to front-end users.       The SWEETLab  is currently demonstrating this concept in water, sanitation, household energy and rural infrastructure programs with diverse partners including Mercy Corps, the Lemelson Foundation, Bridges to Prosperity, Manna Energy Limited and Vestergaard Frandsen, in several countries including Indonesia, Haiti, Guatemala and Rwanda. Funding is requested to expand the deployment of these sensors across water and sanitation programs in Indonesia, Kenya, Rwanda and Haiti with Mercy Corps, Vestergaard Frandsen and Manna Energy Limited.
