Two most important goals of the proposal. 
-stanford students immersion
-indiabiodesign sourcebook

Background: starting fifth year of “Phase 1” – taking India nationals and training them at Stanford
Phase 2 is a mirror image of Phase 1 – taking Stanford students to India to do needs finding.

Got some funding from NIH, but they under-anticipated the faculty handholding necessary to take students over there. 

Regarding sustainability, hoping Stanford faculty will support from a distance in the future. Hoping that people on the ground hosting the students will be the Stanford biodesign alum fellows and Indian fellows.  There will be ongoing costs, travel stipends for students and faculty costs (hope faculty costs will diminish). Hope the alums will take over what Raj and Anurag are doing now in terms of flying over and managing the program. They will need to fundraise for continued stipends – new program at Stanford at Global Health run by Michelle Barry is one source. Hope to get several tens of thousands to keep program running. Second pot is Biodesign fundraising from philanthropy and industry. Paul is not too worried about ongoing funding once we get over the hump and identify a core group of alums and get this program stabilized.

Govt of India – funding 2 more biodesign centers, the start of many more. 

Program is several weeks of clinical immersion; benefit for alumni fellows is high.  

This was the long-term strategy – have a cohort of Indian students who would be loyal to Stanford biodesign support the Stanford students. Now have 17 alumni fellows spread out over India. Good set of emerging mentors, young, plugged in – some are docs working in hospitals, some starting companies etc. Have a large dose of goodwill on mentoring and covering costs for housing etc. Will lock-in financing of student housing – won’t cover faculty. 

Include in the objectives the development of fundraising plan/sustainability and keep us posted on that in future reports.

1008941,2012-02-13,Emily Hodos,"JKJ notes from reviewer feedback call: On the call :John (student founder of IPT) – met Patrick Walsh when he was a freshman in engineering and Madhu – PI

Madhu has been focused on low-income people through Subsistence Marketplace initiative, which was research focused. Became more application/real world focused. Company sponsors interdisciplinary projects. IPT came out of his course. Marketplace Literacy is an Indian nonprofit in urban Chennai and village to engage with 2000 women and families – linking to banks and providing marketplace literacy info.  So – this is really an IPT project.

IPT founded in 2008 by sophomores. Wanted to work on technology that can help people, esp. in disability technology. Built a team of engineering students, partnered with TEC and College of Business and got some resources from them. 
3 iterations of product development, gone to Guatemala twice. Won the Lemelson MIT prize and Clinton Global university group ($4k). Formally partnered with Range of Motion in Guatemala – they will be an early adopter of the technology. Working with Madhu to work in India.

Madhu – wish that Patrick Walsh had taken his course. Start with life circumstances not the technology. We start with the farmer, not the tractor. Tells his engineering students that you cannot start with the technology.

Provide more technical details
-what’s their value proposition, esp. in relation to others such as Open Prosthetics project. Kept it short so didn’t want to get bogged down in tech details, will send a write up and pictures and video. 

I asked for a summary of landscape analysis; have talked to Open Prosthetics project – they are interested in generating and sharing research that’s done ad hoc, whereas IPT’s role is a specific piece of technology then using np business model to disseminate. 

Role of IPT:  IPT is engaging Madhu and his class to engage with the development in India. No need for a letter of support, just an explanation of their role.

IMPACT: they want to think beyond # of prosthetics fitted. Usage data is important- numbers sold is only the beginning. Behavioral indicators are important.

1008943,2012-02-13,Emily Hodos,"JKJ notes from reviewer feedback call: On the call: 
Govind Rao – met him at USAID Saving Lives at Birth conference in DC, didn’t get funded. 

His core competence is not in infants but sensor technology for biomanufacturing. Have licensed a non-contact sensor which means non invasive sensor. Take a molecule and make it into a peel and stick format onto a glass and by shining light can figure out the ph or oxygen level. Also a non invasive glucose sensor – licensed this to BD, in phase 3 clinical trials. 

They have a local GE maternal healthcare unit on campus. During a GE tour, Steve Falk looked at a poster on a noncontact sensor. Have preemies in incubators – when the sensor gets changed daily, it tears the thin skin of the preemies. GE asked whether it could be converted to gel, got an NIH grant to pursue this. Then Jeff Imelt came to visit and asked about the heater/cooler project idea – hadn’t seen an inbubator that combined both. Asked if Govind could extend the concept for BRIC countries and other poor countries. Govind comes from India – where it’s hot, which is why he thought about a cooler too. Did a search of other devices and couldn’t find one that is heating and cooling. 

Have assigned this as a class project. Presenting next week, will send a power point. Confident about hitting the cost target. Also about the market  - some students researched Ethiopia and believe there is a market there too. 

Issues: 

1)	Timeframe is optimistic. But he didn’t back down on the 3-6 month design timeframe. Students have already made a controlled temp environment. Technologically is straightforward, not complex device. One week is too short for students to travel to India (he agreed), but it’s budget question. Might take fewer students and extend the timeframe. He sees this as an exposure trip. 
2)	Role of GE – more details on what they are willing to do. Steve Falk is one of the judges and involved in this class.  Post design – up to GE to make sure it’s a manufacture-ready design. Views this grant as a first step – where does this fit  - in a hospital, home, utility of the device. Will need to raise more $, hope to get more from GE for an immediate match.
3)	Clinical trial and IP.
Will rely on Indian hospital and GE re clinical trials – they have extensive infrastructure in India. GE wants IP rights. Govind has filed a provisional patent, have until next April to decide/start negotiations with GE.

shared the need for a more detailed implementation plan; they did not respond specifically on the call but said they would write it up. They noted that they are traveling to Cameroon in January and will address a lot of these questions then.

ISSUES:

1.	Provide more details on the implementation plan. Address the following questions and any other related issues: How will you validate the market; will people buy this? What is the availability of financing? Who are the local manufacturing partner prospects? Where would materials by sourced for mass production? What are the marketing plans? Are there additional partners on the ground to help with the market awareness and business development?

2.	What is the specific value proposition to the grower/farmer? 

3.	What are the roles and commitments of the partner African institutions?

U of Hartford


3 years ago through provost – having the community innovate on products for agriculture. KARI got involved through poverty eradication commission. They did their needs assessment, saw a bottleneck in production.
Kari is connected throughout East Africa – Uganda, TZ etc. They are based in Kenya but have a broader reach. A Kenyan student who graduated from U of RI 
And introduced it to faculty who moved to U of Hartford. Clarice? Made the connection to KARI and through another grant they were working on

CULTURAL obstacle? It’s fully accepted now, both to grow and eat. KARI was already working with smallholder farmers and introducing different ideas for new businesses. Kenya is trying to move from an economy of production to one of market linkages. To hear the head of KARI, they are positioning themselves from low income to medium income by 2030 through small enterprises, moving to market. People are farming, eating, selling it locally. They promoted it with field days sponsored by the poverty eradication commission – this has been going on for 5 years. Sold in supermarkets in Kisumu and Nairobi but the western farmers can’t link to that market = they want to make it profitable so they can sell to larger markets. 

Marcia – already been recognized that amaranth is way more productive than maize, gross margin is 5times maize.

ROLES OF PARTNERS
U of RI – their students are taking the lead on the seeder. Tom and his students are working on that. U of Hartford is working on the development of the thresher. Wanted local group in Kenya – student went there and used only local materials (had built a prototype as part of capstone design project) with the polytechnic school to build a second prototype. Feel comfortable that there is the local capacity. Students might want to create a startup business, or working artisans to diversify their products. The instructor at the Polytechnic school has shown interest and the minister of agriculture has also shown interest. 

BUSINESS MODEL
-local production through the instructors 

-	we do have local champions, they will come back with more specifics on the possible paths to market. (Students, instructors at polytechnic, local entrepreneurs etc.)

They will benefit greatly from a VentureLab.

1008951,2012-02-13,Emily Hodos,"JKJ notes from reviewer feedback call: On the call: Libby, Amy, Viktor (Grau Serrat)

UNDP in Managua asked them/Libby to come in and look at the trash situation in Eastern Nicaragua on the coast where the trash has polluted the waters. 
Libby met with waste pickers. Decided if she could figure out how to tackle this it could scale. Took 7 students, including 1 dlab student. Spent July 2011 there. 

Questions was how to create economically viable waste sector busiensses, esp. when you are far from urban centers.  Put together some initial ideas with  about 40 women per day, brainstormed the business models. Many different ways to go with a recycling center – wastepickers are an essential piece to cocreating the businesses. Businesses will likely be worker owned coops.

Composting, recycling, agriculture/garden. Creating enterprises amongst 5 distinct groups. Students are part of the enterprise design.  3 groups of students (bio digesters, recycling etc) but all would be involved. 

Issue: Where is the Innovation?
Biodigester will be located at the slaughterhouse. All integrated. 
Technology: biodigesters. Looking at what’s available and create a report with case studies given # of pigs, cows, trash as well as energy requirement. Still in the process of figuring this out. The course / students will be going this at the end of this semester to close in on this question in January.  Not sure if there is a lot of technical innovation involved. But - Using the output of the slaughterhouse in the biodigester – haven’t seen this anywhere. Haven’t heard of this before. So there would need to be some biological innovations and also with the processing of the materials that go into this. Not seeing biodigesters built alongside slaughterhouses. 

Literature review. Looking at other technologies, not just the 2 mentioned. Will be building a small biodigester with Blue Energy. Lit review – reading case studies - been doing this, students have looked for this.  Very little out there of biodigesters using input from slaughterhouses at least in Central America. Not commonplace. What is innovative is bringing this to (biodigester technology is mature) Central America and alongside slaughterhouses.

?? also small technologies that cannot predict yet.  Crusherers/mixers etc??


8951-11 MIT continued.

Also, marrying these businesses to approach zero waste is innovative. Collection, processing business and packaging the methane are all possibilities. 

TRAVEL: 82%
This is a good time for DLAb, Provost has committed to $1/2M/yr in general budget, but ramping up. Starting with $200k this year, 300 next, which includes travel and staffing. Will have more funding available. Class of 61 gift was a fund for international travel for dlab. Current needs as we start up these classes, need the funding to get there. Longer term, next 3 yrs. “we will be at a point where we can support student travel for these classes. So this is bridge funding.” If NCIIA doesn’t fund all the travel, Public Service Center would pay for 10-20K she thinks. Public Service Center administers the travel funding during the summer. Don’t want students to fundraise, want all students to come. Could ask students to pay a portion themselves and then provide $ for those who can’t. Energy Initiative might also have funding. Undergrads also have the Eurap ? program. 
(Phil - So we can safely shave 10-20k off travel.) 

This project is earlier stage in terms of partnership collaboration, does that hurt them (asked Amy)? I said no, partners are identified. I said what makes this different from previous proposals is the focus on enterprise development, which we are happy to see.

This started as part of a humanitarian project in 96. Five years later he worked in Cambodia. Just got back from Cambodia where 4 systems have been in place for 2 yrs. Spoke with the Ministry of Rural Development there. (they are interested but Arup said the govt works very slowly and he wants to pursue partnerships with private companies.) Eventually want to bring the business element to Cambodia after it’s proven in India.

With the nciia funds he can attract other funds. Will visit some companies in India soon (he will be a Fullbright scholar there starting Spring 2012) that may be interested. Definitely his strategy is to start with the middle class so that he can 

If the absorbant material is available locally, it would be possible to scale. 

Implementation: a private entity/company.

Goal for India – this is the time to move it to the private sector and expand beyond one states. Enhanced Water and Air Pollution Prevention (India) Ltd, and others are interested in licensing. 

Motivation – you won’t get sick 5 yrs from now is not enough – everyone has to be compensation at every level. 

There have been four students involved over the years, but they come and go. Working with US student and a Thai student – creating a network. US student is involved in creating the eship plan, wants to take this material to S. Africa. In India, working with 2 different universities – a faculty member and his students will work in the lab where they have installed one unit. 

Fullbright will start Spring 2012 in India – he will be in the south and install a system.  Would consider coming from India or Michael German, grad student at Lehigh might also come.  

IMPACT: goal is to make this technology SUSTAINABLE. How many people are getting safe water every year and how many more people have been employed/have a stake in this technology – wealth generation. Can only do this with an economically sustainable model. 

 Want to accomplish by 2013: create a pipeline for making this material in India (and Cambodia) so that it is more affordable (and no customs!).  Identify the private companies that he wants to work with.

Main issue: where is the tech innovation?
Comes down to the assembly – this makes all the difference. The modular assembly (design innovation) and the novel materials.. Keeping the microclimate constant is a real challenge also, esp. in East Africa b/c temp swings in a day could be 20-30 degrees. How do you do this without external energy systems? The flaps on the side will open and close depending on the weather. Have done the research on the time of day, and the temperature; the local people there have a better sense of temperature than we do and Khanjan will depend on them to maintain the temp.

Need to do more research on the rice bags as a material option, because these are cheap and readily available.

Payback time? And are the materials too flimsy to be worth a $200 investment.

Some of the materials they are using are new materials that have shelf life for 50 years. They have had a greenhouse in use for several years and it has not fallen apart. Payback of three crop cycles is about 9 months, this is realistic. May even be 2 cycles. Market linkage is a larger issue. 

Role of students in this project: greenhouse idea came from a student team. Came from a real need that partners expressed in Tanzania. Students came up with the design. About 15 students have been involved so far, 5 key members. 

These greenhouse customers will be ideal customers for other products, such as a fruit and veg drier they are working on. 

HOW WILL HE MEASURE IMPACT: increased income by farmers; this will be hard to measure. Also, the number of greenhouses owned / paid for by farmers. This will happen only if there is direct economic value. Another measure is geographic penetration.

(Mashavu Update –  2 kiosks (one rotates) across 6 locations. Trying to go to 20 locations. 12 people at one kiosk. 10-20 people a day, and this is without their own devices that need govt approval. Right now using off the shelf devices that work well. Team designed devices need a lot more work; they are cheaper and more rugged, but hard to make locally. Looking to form a partnership with a company; the devices design for manufacturing.  Met with Jhpiego but nothing came of it; meeting with Seimens this week, still need a partner.)

Dan worked with the NGO for years (the university has) – so it’s not new, been going on for years. He comes to them with projects every year. Interdisciplinary teams. Contact in Thailand is an alum, working in building products. He would come up with needs that they used for sr. design projects and he hosts some Cal students in Thailand. EWB got involved with him and block presses in Thailand and then when it got to hey let’s design a building with these materials, there was a red flag – how do we design for this and is it safe. 

Doing research and testing on campus for the last 2 yrs. Now ready to implement all these engineering expertise into designing housing. Also have to take into account rainy season and construction season. 

How have they incorporated the cultural/design issues – this seems to fit within the type of construction that is happening in Thailand and Vietnam. Similar building product that looks similar to clay fired bricks. 

Commercialization plan
Product is the equipment to manufacture the blocks. The NGO is Thailand – this is the service that they are providing in Thailand, Vietnam and even India. They’ve been manufacturing and providing equipment for roofing tiles. NGO would be selling the equipment to individual family or collective or small village and they provide small business loans. You buy the press, we’ll loan you the $, you can pay us back in time and you can make blocks to sell to others. One press you can build 10-15 houses per year so you are funding micro busineses essentially. NGO would also do the marketing and training up front. And because you can reduce the cost and the reliance on cement. 

Dan – break the barrier to make sure it’s SAFE. Dan doesn’t want to make $ for him or his students, but the ngo will make a profit which will go back into the ngo.

Bernie’s role: will go out to field/Africa and meet with partners. Act as mentor. 
Krista will take the lead on this. The proposal is not just to expand the market for Brilliance. Want to understand the medical device market in Africa, using Brilliance. Kara has worked with diagnostics. Questions are where are the markets & distribution models? How to make this economically sustainable? Root issue is what is the market, where does it work? Can we use market knowledge to push out Brilliance and targeted studies in 3 counties, can we use this for other devices. Do market driven models work. Less about product development – suspect that there will be some innovations. A lot less consistency of power and voltage surges in Kenya, Zambia and Mozambique. Also, ambient temp might be higher, might have to go back and look at thermal design. Krista hopes this is broader than Brilliance. 

Have “millions” of other products. Want to narrow the scope to start with, easier for students. This will be informative in general. Want to understand how these markets work so we can use this info WHILE you’re doing product development on other devices. 

Bernie – doing lots of projects in extreme affordability class. Any info of a general nature would be valuable for the whole community. Incight for example – they do 10 a year. Have been doing more in ag, but medical devices have been focused on India and Bangladesh. NW is digging into Asia, D-Rev is digging into Africa. 
Generate knowledge and expertise around market needs and challenges/approaches in 3 countries. Expected to help immediate project (Brilliance) and feed back into educational program at Stanford and NW. Expect to publish on this. Also want to understand commercialization and hope that the new center at Stanford for Social innovation will select this projects. Fairly confident in performance, but temp and electricity will likely be issues, if there are other changes/re-design, that would have to do under other funding/part of extreme affordability. Bernie say they subsidize the design as part of the extreme affordability course. 40% of budget is faculty support. Small amount would go to Bernie, some to Krista to head up the D-Rev, some to Kara. Will play itself out as project develops. Travel includes lots of students, Mulago said it would pay for Krista’s travel.  This is a market study – an exploration. Krista dropped Carol’s name…saying she is interested in Africa.

Joseph: this may be interesting for Miguel (clean tech in Africa) if it were invest-able. Would need a clear team with a leader to take this product and make a company of it. VW is oriented toward for profit entities. Way in which an impact investor could look at this and see high return based on risk. Doesn’t think it’s a fit right now. He and Krista will have a follow on conversation.

1008971,2012-02-13,Emily Hodos,"JKJ notes from reviewer feedback call: on the call Greg Ziegler (who attended the SV TeachingLab)

Issue: cultural acceptance
Greg was just in Ethiopia doing an investigation on the supply chain. In most places, poor people are already mixing grains – t’ef is expensive and wealthier people have a larger % of it. SoPoor people are already substituting grains. FAO has done tests of other mixtures (noted in a footnote on page 3 of the proposal) which I asked him to expand onl. 

What he’s done so far to prove there is a market:  he claims that there is already a nascent market, small bakeries are selling this on the street.  Mama Fresh injera – mentioned in the proposal – are exporting injera now, with a small local market. They compete with injera made outside of Ethiopia. 

Issue: Business model: 
African Climate Exchange came to them 2 yrs ago asking for help with the technology. They would establish the business. The head of ACE operates Professional Technical Expertise, a company that finds technical people. He would put the team together. He also has connections to one of the large hospitals. Distribution network would include people who would normally be selling on the street, carrying wood etc. 

Marketing – they would go after larger, institutional contracts first like a hospital, world food program could buy it for school lunch programs. They’ll do this first to establish cash flow then go after the residential market. 

Inflation is measured by the cost of injera. 75% of calories are from injera.

Would a centralized idea put some people out of work? Probably. The injera is a source of income. But they’d hope to rehire some of these people.

Value proposition – what is the value proposition to the urban customer vs the rural customer? 

Some people are eating pasta or other products, would rather have injera.There is a shortage b/c there’s no system for centralized distribution. A lot of infrastructure is not in place. IT’s an exciting time to start a business in Ethiopia, 10 yrs after the communists left.  Trying to work eship into his course…haven’t figured out how to collaborate with HESE yet.

Greg was a little defensive; said he was not “a business guy” and that his expertise is technical, what he is contributing to the project.

1008965,2012-06-26,Emily Hodos,"Email update from Khanjan on 6/22/12: The greenhouse team spent a week in Uganda and then joined students and faculty from the Altoona campus in Kigali, Rwanda.
 
The consolidated UP-Altoona team then worked with the Star School to put up two greenhouses on their campus.
These greenhouses will be used to grow produce for internal consumption as well as for the local market, thus providing another revenue stream.
We also established a few local linkages to help Mavuuno Greenhouses set up distribution channels in Rwanda. A more formal collaboration between HESE and the Altoona campus is being developed to continue work on the greenhouses and other ventures in Rwanda and elsewhere.
 
Meanwhile in Nairobi, rapid progress is being made by Mavuuno Greenhouses to set up their manufacturing facilities and sales channels for the Central Kenyan market. Several partnerships with Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) as well as commercial banks are being developed to help smallholders get access to capital.
 
Another exciting news is that the licensing contract between Mavuuno and Penn State was signed yesterday morning. Thanks to the International Sustainable Development Projects Law Clinic, Office of Technology Management and the College of Engineering for their support. The business model for this social enterprise is truly a precedent for HESE@Penn State. In a nutshell, we are licensing (with modest royalties and token licensing fees) the greenhouse technology to a Kenyan start-up – Mavuuno Greenhouses (with two Penn State PhDs in the lead). Mavuuno will manufacture and sell low-cost greenhouses designed for smallholder farmers across East Africa. In parallel, we have developed educational materials to train recent polytechnic graduates who will buy the kits, install the greenhouses on farms and provide basic training on greenhouse operations…thus improving their (and farmers) livelihoods while fostering food security. Twelve of these construction entrepreneurs have been trained and are ready to go out on construction assignments!

Thanks for your patience; I finally had a chance to read your report this morning and was really pleased with all the hard work (talking to 100 farmers!) and progress you made on your January trip.  

I do have a few questions for you - no rush on responding - when you have time:

Did you take an actual soar dryer prototype with you and show it to anyone?

What did you learn about the ability to pay for technologies such as your solar dryer product - who will buy them (besides the Min. of Ag!)

Is the corn sheller that you mention the design that comes out of MIT/D-lab?

In your milestones you list start manufacturing Solar Dryer units for the Sept. trip - how many will you make/take?

Do you have any video content you can share with me yet?

I really look forward to seeing you Aug. 23 in Cambridge at the VentureLab workshop - it will be right before you head back to Cameroon and hopefully will be really helpful in preparing for that trip.

Also developing the arsenic absorbtion material in the lab but want to do it Want to collect data to evaluate the performance of the technology. Decided to start a new company which is being formalized now.A lot of this is funded/supported through govt. The new company will be called INDUS Aquapure? (for profit) will be focused on arsenic and flouride safe water. Devoted to drinking water treatment, this in cooperation with an Indian company, Enhanced Water and Air Pollution Prevention Ltd. (they will share some employees and mgmt. but it will be a separate company). This is in order to respond to RFPs from govt for clean water - this is mostly funded by the goct. Also looking for apt. complexes / middle class customers. But need to be certification/legitimization in the private sector. Mike (getting a PhD in environmental engineering) will play an integral role in the technical development and testing of the material and looking at other sources of funding. Arup had questions about his $10k faculty stipend can be used for summer salary etc. and I said yes as long as it's directly related to the grant.

Answer: The individual farmers are willing to pay for them. Wer actually asked them for a price point that will be convenient for them. The average price we got from them ranged between $50 - $70. Whereas our estimated price point is $80 as of now. Hopefully, if we can get manufacturing done in Cameroon, this price point can be reduced to $70.

Is the corn sheller that you mention the design that comes out of MIT/D-lab?

Answer: Yes. We are in talks now to establish a formal collaboration with the D lab so as to test their portfolio of technologies.

In your milestones you list start manufacturing Solar Dryer units for the Sept. trip - how many will you make/take?

Answer: We are currently manufacturing between 20 – 50 Solar Dryers. Our plan is to manufacture some in the US and others in Cameroon. We may manufacture close to 40 more in Cameroon. I ll keep you posted on this update.

1008944,2012-09-27,Emily Hodos,"Update from Roland to JKJ on 8/31/12: I just wanted to keep you in the loop of developments from our end. Using our ground up approach, we have identified other voids that can be filled by us in a very sustainable way. Such voids include: 1. To become an aggregator and distributor of technologies. This is made possibloe through our partnership with www.acrest.org. They will become our engineering lab where we will test and manufacture allour technologies, They have been in the business for over 10years now and have worked with MIT, Purdue University and University of Kentucky. Engineering students spend the summer working on creating and recreating technologies. They have worked on most open source technologies that are available on the market. The founder of the company is an architect by training and the Chair at the UN Energy, Africa(http://www.polismed.org/?p=495). Our partnership with ACREST will enable us to identify and bring prototypes as well as finished products for manufacturing in large scale in a sustainable way. JolaVenture will become a distribution partner to all these technologies while providing capacity building training to the population. We are currently manufacturing 10000units of the corn sheller and to produce an additional 40000 in Cameroon through ACREST.
 
2. JolaVenture will also be able to aggregate produce from our farmers and channel to existing markets. This will be easy to do since we already have an established brand in the region and country as a whole.
 
3. JolaVenture can also perform testing for other technologies especially those developed here in the U.S. This testing can be performed at a fee.
 
4. JolaVenture can become a test and commercialization partner for NCIIA born technologies. I found out that most of the projects during this VentureLab where by students who had no plans to continue working on them beyond their graduation.
 
Through JolaVenture, Northeastern Unviersity has created a Dialogue of Innovation - a 6 week program during the summer during which an interdisciplinary team of student(mostly engineers & business) spend time in Cameroon identifying problem areas after which they will come back and create solutions for them. This will give us the ability to spit out continous innovations - something only Khajan at Penn State is close to doing.
 
I have also been given a faculty position at one of top Universities in Cameroon to teach a course which I design - Technology Development for Sustainability - a theory course for JolaVenture.
 
I am not sure how we can position this to be of greater value to NCIIA but I know that your input in this can give us a better sense of oppotunities that can be the low hanging fruits.

thanks for the interim report (received via Bernie); I also had a chance to look through the slides and listen to some of the early October student presentation that Nicole Rappin sent me. First of all, please convey my compliments to the students for such a thorough job.  I may ask permission to use their slides as an example for other student teams in the future...I do have a few follow up questions if you don't mind:

1) So, the 2 main takeaways I got were 1) no technical modifications needed (why not?) and 2) you are moving forward with a pilot to introduce Brilliance (where and to which target customers?)

2) The audio recording of the presentation I got from Nicole was difficult to understand so forgive me if I'm asking an obvious question - how long did it take (in East Africa) and then back in the US to conduct, analyze and present this due diligence - approximate # of days? 

3) Were the 2 students from different backgrounds (business/engineering?)

4) Finally, slide #42 showed (I think) a market for about 2000+ Brilliance devices in the 3 countries combined - is that correct? If so, given the small size of the market (compared to India)are there additional costs/challenges?

We thank you for the extraordinary support you provide for each of the NCIIA grantees.  As multiple recipients, we are most grateful.  Adam had a recent conversation with you about the careful change in direction that IPT (currently renamed Bump) feels best serves the larger purpose of the organization and the grant.  We are most grateful to you for supporting this change in direction.

The suggested change is based on considerable work including a yearlong project in my two-sequence course (originally supported by NCIIA) that included field research in India.  The above-arm prosthetic does not seem to be the best direction to take.  The team has brainstormed a number of alternatives and come with a really good approach - to focus on child-size below-the arm prosthetic that serves a very important need.

We request using the same budget and categories as previously submitted.  We ask for your approval for this change of direction.  If there is any documentation or explanation we can provide, we look forward to the opportunity.

Thanks for following up; Adam and I had a good conversation recently and he explained the need to pivot / change focus. We find that this is sometimes the case with our grantees after exploring the technology and the market(s) and I appreciate you bringing this to my attention.  I do support the direction you will pursue in terms of focusing on the below the arm prosthetic for children. I know the team is working hard on trying to identify the market size and adjust your design thinking to smaller sizes.

As long as you are using the budget as approved (give or take 5% in each category), there is no need for any formal budget reallocation/change.

We had submitted our interim report for our SV2011 grant on April 26, 2013, but received no comments back. We assumed that no news was good news. By Penn State’s accounting, the grant ended on August 31, 2013, and so I owe you a final report. The first shipment of injera was exported from Ethiopia to London this week. The fledgling company, NutrAfrica, now has 25 employees. The machine built with the grant has been installed at Penn State and we now need to validate it and optimize the injera formula for machine production. I am teaching the Product and Process Design Class for African Markets this fall with 8 students enrolled. I am considering a follow-on SV grant. Thanks for taking the chance on the idea.

Good to hear from you. I did read your interim report and noted that you were on track and impact could be big! At that point the machine was 90% built. So exciting that a venture has been launched with 25 employees!! I'm confused as to how exporting has begun if the machine is in PA?

Hi Raj,

Thanks so much for your final report which I’ve had a chance to review and congratulations on the Sourcebook. Two quick questions - are you tracking commercial outcomes (by the Indian docs/entrepreneurs and the Stanford students) as this gets rolled out and if so, how? In other words, with regards to the mentoring of students our grant supported, are any of those projects/technologies moving forward? 

Second, where's the best place to look for a copy/final version of the Sourcebook (I did see something a while ago, would appreciate a final copy/link).

Thanks so much and I'm glad our small grant was useful in the context of a large and ambitious program. Regards, Jennifer

1008937,2013-11-26,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Hi Jennifer.
Greetings from India (and apologies for the delay in responding). I am now in Mumbai---and getting ready for our big summit next week in Delhi.
To answer your question, yes, we absolutely track the progress of each of the projects that come from our program---namely the ones our Stanford-India Biodesign fellows and our Stanford students work on. If you just look at the fellows' projects, all six (dating back to 2009) are still very active and have received large grants from the Government of India, Government of Canada, Gates Foundation, Indo-US Endowment fund, and VCs/angels. One product was launched a few months back through a licensing arrangement with Hindustan Latex, a large healthcare company in India. I am the lead (unpaid) advisor for all the of these projects even after they leave the SIB nest, and generally talk with the entrepreneurs every few weeks.
That said, the student project that was funded by the NCIIA grant has not been pursued further, though two of the students are still very engaged with other med tech projects for India. I think the clinical immersion in India probably helped solidify their focus on India/emerging markets.
I think the biggest opportunity to create large impact will be through the dissemination of the sourcebook and curriculum across India. We will be able to track the number of institutions using them, but unlikely to truly know how many students/project have been impacted.
I think the NCIIA grant was catalytic for this sourcebook/curriculum project, which allows us to share our methodologies broadly. I think it will make a big difference. Thanks again for your support.

Right after Venture Lab in August of 2012 in Cambridge, I headed to Thailand.  Literally the day after returning from Thailand, I was elected Department Chair and was instated the following day.  We had solid plans during the Fall of 2012 with a trip to India, but my duties as a new department chair just diverted my attention too much.  Also, from the Venture Lab recommendations, we added a second non-profit/NGO as a collaborator that Fall.  In December 2012, they lent us equipment valued in excess of $50,000 to work with.  While we have continued working with our partner NGO in Thailand, the new partnership has been invaluable for creating contacts with groups wanting to build with compressed earth blocks.  Most of my limited time has been to developing these links with organizations working in Mexico and Indonesia.  If we receive an extension through this summer, my students and I are looking to take trips to India in June and Mexico later in the summer through the new contacts.
 
So, my request is to receive an extension through the summer (say until the end of August or September); we’ll still file the report due this month as an interim report rather than a final report.",Internal Note,Completed,Normal,00570000003QASWAA4,Post Award Note--2014/03/01 Rachel Agoglia

The trip to India in June has two purposes:
1)      To meet with the Auroville Earth Institute.  They’re a well-established and innovative group building with compressed earth blocks and selling related equipment.  I have had a number of exchanges about how our partnering would be mutually beneficial (they have experience with making blocks and building whereas our expertise is in structural behavior/design).
2)      I’ve been invited to a construction site in a remote village in northern India  (Sainji Village, Uttarakhand) to gain intimate experience working with locals in such a setting and how our construction instructions translate.
 
The trip to Mexico is to work with one of our more recent contacts, the Missionaries to San Luis Rio Colorado (Mexico).  Bob and Nancy Monfort, who run the ministry, came to Cal Poly for one of our compressed earth block demos/workshops in August 2013.  They have been building housing in the Sonoran Desert, but have had to use relatively expensive and low quality bricks (not to mention fired in ovens which burn too much of the desert vegetation and pollute the valley) and see compressed earth blocks as a great alternative.  They’re hoping to have money raised for a compressed earth block machine (one from Dwell Earth) and start work during Summer 2014.  Please see http://www.slrc-mexico.com/block-machine.html and scroll down a bit.  I’d like to be on site when they start up to help them out and see how groups get started without prior experience.

We just received a USAID Saving Water For Food (http://www.securingwaterforfood.org/) grant for our greenhouse venture…to build for profit enterprises around greenhouses in Sierra Leone and Mozambique. We already have six greenhouses in SL but operations have slowed down because of Ebola. This is a three year grant for $500,000 (+ $225K Cost Share) and will really help us do more rigorous assessment of the venture. The official announcement will be made in Stockholm at the end of the month…and I will send you the PR as soon as I get it. Also, I will try my best to get VentureWell recognized there.
On the grant side, most of the funds have been used up…but the accounts are not settled because people were traveling and budgets are charged only when they return. Our two fellows were evacuated from Sierra Leone 10 days back and we should be able to file some of the reports.",Internal Note,Completed,Normal,00570000003QASWAA4,Post Award Note--2014/09/05 Rachel Agoglia

1008971,2014-09-22,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Following up post FR (gold star) Hi Greg, Hope the school year is off to a good start. I'm just checking in on the Injerama project with NutrAfrica; even though the grant is closed, I'm really interested in how things are going. When you get a chance, can you email me a quick update. Did a new injerama machine get installed? I'm also very interested to know how much total funding you've raised (you were going after more USAID funding I believe) and had an angel investment of $300k (!!). I'm also curious to know whether the business model is sustainable yet and how you measure progress (# staff/products sold) etc. Are any of your students still involved?

Thanks for the continued interest. I had an engineering intern from Montpellier in France validate the machine this summer. The concept is solid, but we identified several design issues that would make the machine, as is, less than robust in an African environment. In the meantime, we have identified an industrial crepe machine manufactured in China (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRWRp1YabHY) that we believe can be modified at a lower cost than building from scratch. NutrAfrica finally has a transformer in place for the factory in Ethiopia, but has yet to get the connection to the grid. However, even once it is connected, there are regular power outages, hence, they have a 500 kVA generator on order. The next domino is then the cost of diesel, which they hope to mitigate by using unrefined jatropha oil obtained from local farmers (the trees were planted years ago for another project). Presently the factory is being expanded to include some traditional mitads (“griddles”) that will be heated by burning pelletized coffee parchment (this is a waste product from coffee processing). This material burns much cleaner than the eucalyptus wood that is commonly used (we’ve done some studies here at PSU on it). While the long-term goal is to get away from combustion, in the short run NutrAfrica though it wise to have these available for backup. Colleagues here at Penn State have submitted a concept paper to USAID focused on the energy issues.
 
Coincident with the machine design, we have been investigating the fermentation process with the goal of producing a reliable starter culture. The latest work in this area involved an assessment of the microbial diversity (universal bacteria, yeast & molds, lactic acid bacteria) for a sample obtained in Ethiopia, followed throughout the fermentation process. I was in Ethiopia this August for a Borlaug Fellowship workshop and had the opportunity to present some of what we’ve been up to (see attached presentation). In the audience was a local entrepreneur. He like the idea of the “Dirkosh Chips”. The next day he was test marketing them in the convenience store that he owns, and they got a very favorable reception. I have yet to hit with USAID. I plan to submit for the MSU/GCFSI Food Systems Innovation Grants (ADVANCE NOTICE for RFA- MSU/GCFSI Food Systems Innovation Grants) this coming spring. Everything takes longer than I’d like, especially in Africa. I had intended to submit an abstract for next year’s OPEN meeting, but the Sept. 10 deadline crept up on me. I was going to prepare an updated version of the attached presentation. Take care,

As I mentioned at OPEN this spring, we are working with a manufacturer (Reading Bakery Systems, http://www.readingbakery.com/) to scale and commercialize the injera making machine we designed with our grant from NCIIA (now VentureWell). To accomplish this, we need to take the unit we built and transfer it to Reading’s facility. However, the University is hesitant to let us do this, in part, because the contract had no specific language on title of equipment, but the Terms & Conditions of the grant read, “that award funds and any income from may only be used for charitable religious, scientific, literary or educational purposes,” which they have interpreted to mean that transfer to Reading would be inappropriate. I did point out to them that part of VentureWell’s mission is to “cultivate a pipeline of creators and entrepreneurs who can turn ideas into successful commercial products.” If this transfer is appropriate from your perspective, a letter from VentureWell to that effect would help me move this forward. I hope this finds you well. Take care and thanks,

I’m glad to hear that this project is still going strong. 

The purpose of the Award Letter is to ensure that the grant funds are used as described ""in the approved budget for the purpose outlined in the proposal”.  You stated in your grant proposal that one of your objectives was to complete the design and scale up of a prototype injera-making machine. It seems to me that the transfer of this machine to Reading Bakery Systems for commercialization and scale is in keeping with what these funds were intended for.

As I’m sure you know, I think the machine is subject to the IP policies of your university (although maybe you’ve already worked that out).  As described in VenturWell's Faculty Grants guidelines (https://venturewell.org/facultygrants/ ):

VentureWell supports courses and/or programs that lead to the creation of student E-Teams as they work toward commercialization of their inventions and takes no financial or ownership interest in the projects that result from grant funding. Ownership of discoveries or inventions resulting from activities financed by VentureWell grant funds will be governed by grantee institutions’ intellectual property (IP) policies. If a school does not have an IP policy, then the institution must develop an agreement that establishes ownership of ideas resulting from students’ work. VentureWell takes no financial or ownership interest in the projects that result from grant funding.  

I hope this is helpful—please let me know if you need something more formal.

We wish you the best of luck with the Injera machine!
