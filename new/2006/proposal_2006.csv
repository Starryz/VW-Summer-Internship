Its prime objective is to improve the sustainability of the community and its main livelihood by developing a concise, yet thorough, Development Plan to ensure the ongoing quality, financing, development and management of this small, ceramic based village. We intend to accomplish this by designing and planning a new prototype for this village that will encourage the development of increased tourist activities, increased craft quality, improved community capacity and management systems, innovative production facilities as well as a concerted effort to improve the international profile of this village and its craftspeople. In this manner this village will serve as a blueprint of success and longevity for other endeavors of this scale and will provide the ongoing labor, livelihood and expertise needed to lift these people from the poverty and desperation they currently face.

The lantern must be extremely robust, easily repairable, inexpensive, use available indigenous materials, and be supplied in kit form for local assembly or manufacture. Together with the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, at which the PI is a visiting professor, and the University of Developmental Studies, we are working with communities in Northern Ghana for whom the lantern is intended. Direct consultation with these groups, with whom the PI has a strong relationship through annual working trips with Cooper Union students, is an integral part of our design process. The solution must make available the ownership, installation and maintenance of the complete system to these communities. To facilitate this we plan investigations into and consultations with: local Agricultural banks for micro financing; local workshop facilities for fabrication/assembly; local district councils and NGOs for guidelines on installation and maintenance.        Development of the prototype lanterns is currently in the hands 24 freshmen and will continue next semester as an independent study. In Phase I, the PI and two students will install two prototype systems in Ghana in early summer 2007. These will be used to gather extensive data for both the technological and sociological operation of the system to provide input for more extensive trials in Phase II in 2008.

The goal of this proposed project is to develop small-scale, distributed ethanol production systems in the context of closed-loop, diversified agricultural production systems.  Specific objectives are to (1) innovatively design and build appropriate biomass combustion, fermentation and distillation systems for low-income agricultural producers, (2) use systems-level economic and life-cycle models to analyze the effects of such technologies on regional sustainability factors, (3) investigate the applicability of small-scale ethanol production technology to the developed world as well as the developing world, and (4) provide hands-on learning experiences that students can learn how to make informed decisions and engineering judgments about the sustainability of biorenewable production systems.  The technology and systems analysis models from this project will be generally applicable to both the developing and developed world to promote renewable energy and sustainable economic development in regions with small-scale producers with low capital investment capabilities.",1003788,Final Review,3788-06,0017000001LSVnDAAX,a2C39000002zYsyEAE,01239000000Ap02AAC,The Lemelson Foundation

The approach of placing water in a PET bottle in the sunlight has been shown to be effective in killing bacteria (SODIS, 2002).  Recently, the use of TiO2 (Titania) as a photocatalyst has shown promising lab results in destroying not only bacteria but also other harmful substances such as arsenic and herbicides (Litter et al., 2005).  The main idea is the use of recycled plastic bottles coated with TiO2 that can purify the water when they are exposed to sunlight for just a few hours and then store the water.  A recent breakthrough is that the bottles can be coated at room temperature by adding acid to the Titania emulsion (Meichtry et al., 2005).  Our own mathematical modeling and experimental work in bringing the technology from the lab to the field has shown that the coating process is relatively simple to do in remote areas and is effective with bacteria, arsenic, and a pesticide and that a simple dye pill will enable the user to determine completion of the process through color change, even under variable weather conditions.

Producing Bio-fuel from Water Purification Waste,50000,Producing Bio-fuel from Water Purification Waste,University of Central Florida, ,2006-10-27,2006-11-03, , ,"This proposal describes a partnership between a water purification company, a public utility, and a public university that seeks to integrate two emerging environmental technologies   algae-based water purification and bio-fuel.        Aquafiber is a water purification company with over 20 patents for its innovative use of algae to clean water 1000 times more effectively than other natural methods.  This process produces a significant amount of bio-waste currently given away as fertilizer.    Aquafiber s technology has been thoroughly tested over several years and is now being marketed.       Preliminary analysis and prototyping by Aquafiber suggests that their algae waste can produce diesel or ethanol fuel several times more efficiently per acre harvest than currently popular sources of bio-fuel (e.g., corn, sugar cane).  Consequently, Aquafiber approached OUC, Orlando s electric and water utility, and UCF to investigate designing micro-processing plants that could convert algae to fuel with minimal infrastructure costs.      Overall, this proposal seeks to use dirty water as a source of renewable energy.  Most of the technologies involved are well developed and entering commercial markets.  However, our partnership needs additional funds to support research and prototype development.  UCF would engage students and faculty from chemical engineering, biology, and business to conduct research necessary to validate and optimize this conversion process.  OUC is interested in matching this support by investing in a test site that purifies power plant effluent, produces bio-diesel, and fuels OUC trucks.         If successful, we envision efficient, inexpensive, stand-alone systems capable of cleaning water and producing renewable energy anywhere that algae grows.

North Central College SIFE has sold approximately 2000 pounds of shade-grown coffee produced by small-plot San Lucas family farmers.  While we intend to continue to expand coffee sales, from the beginning, we have had diversification as a goal.  During a recent visit to San Lucas, we learned of a new women s center that will feature classrooms dedicated to teaching weaving.  An activity with mythological, cosmological, and historical significance, weaving is a meaningful, socially-valued activity that women easily accommodate to family and community life.  It requires few energy inputs and is compatible with Maya women s domestic tasks including household budget management.  Moreover, hand-woven textiles are among the most popular items purchased by tourists, offering women the opportunity to earn cash income for their families.      This project will: maximize the number of women who acquire or improve their weaving skills; assist women to form a weaving cooperative; provide appropriate technology and technical assistance; and offer marketing consultation to help the cooperative expose attractive products to the widest possible market.

In developing nations, people spend much of their time engaged in subsistence agriculture or working on plantations and ranches.  In the US, migrant workers perform most agricultural labor and an increasing amount of construction labor.  Much of the outdoor work is performed during the seasons when thunderstorm frequency is highest.  Therefore these laborers are disproportionately likely to be injured or killed by lightning.  Until recently, the cost of the equipment necessary to provide sound, science-based lightning hazard-warning decision support has been so great that only the most high-risk operations, such as those carried out at the NASA Kennedy Space Center, could afford it.  The alternatives have been rules of thumb and a number of devices on the market without benefit of rigorous scientific testing and evaluation.  Now there is a new, easy to use, robust instrument available that can provide the same kind of science-based lightning hazard-warning decision support that has been used at NASA KSC for three decades, at a fraction of the cost.  In this proposal we request support to develop a cost-effective lightning hazard-warning decision support package suitable for widespread deployment on behalf of the masses of low-income outdoor laborers around the world.
