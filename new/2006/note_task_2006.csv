Dear Jennifer:

I am glad to inform you that our team conducted a successful training at the University of Dar-es-Salaam (UDSM), Tanzania, last week regarding the NCIIA sponsored ""Enabling Pharmaceutical Bioexploration in Tanzania"" We were at UDSM from April 14 to 21. Our partners at UDSM expressed satisfaction with the organization and delivery of the training program. They are now set and anxious to implement their portion of the project.

I understand our Office of Research and Sponsored Programs (ORSP) at Rutgers is expecting some paperwork from NCIIA, which is required for completing the subcontract papers for UDSM. I called yesterday to followup with you on this, unfortunately you were at a meeting at the time. Please pardon me if action has been taken because I have not been in contact with ORSP today.

In case action is still pending, we would need your help to get the necessary papers to Rutgers so we can finalize the subcontract with UDSM and our partners can go to work without losing time. Some of the field actitivities in Tanzania are seasonal and we would like to capture all the plant sampling actitivities at the appropriate times of the year, most of which should start right away.

Kindly let us know if you need additional info from us to complete the paperwork.

Regards and best wishes, Albert.

I returned from Peru just before the earthquake hit.  After seeing these rural communities, I am wondering how they will survive such event.  Of course, we have heard a lot about what happened in the big cities, but the small towns have the most precarious infrastructure and I expect the biggest losses.

I wanted to report to you now that I have come back and give you some update on what I saw and discussed with my colleagues at PUCP.  As you know, our Sustainable Visions grant deferred our designation of a specific project to pursue until I had visited these communities.  We have now some ideas and my sense is that we want to focus on those that will enable the economic development of these rural communities.

I think I will confer with Burt Swersey and Rob Chernow about these ideas and then proceed to make plans with my colleagues at PUCP.  My hope is that this will be the first of many projects on these communities so that we can have a long-lasting and prosperous relationship with them.

I will keep you posted.

This has been an incredibly busy summer with fantastic result!

I designed three machine for processes relating to plastic thatch and 
bio-diesel production. I have also worked out a complete process for 
converting plastic waste into a very low-cost roofing solution for 
tropical regions.  I will be needing help with the patent process. Will 
you be considering next stage funding for on-going projects or should I 
be looking for other funding sources ? I have a prototype for one of the 
machines being built in Ecuador now- but I will need further funding to 
make the necessary changes and to test the roofing system and the 
business model (this will include some money to buy-out my time from the 
College so I can move this process forward in a timely manner!). I had 
one nearly disastrous experiment trying to convert a gas water heater to 
run on bio-diesel - I over pressurized it with heat and blew it apart 
(fortunately I had it filled with water at the time and not oil - you

1003913,2007-10-29,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Testimonial: 
Hi Jennifer:

Remember when i asked you to help me get in touch with Amy Smith - I met
her at the NCIIA meeting last March - I remembered something she
mentioned and then she introduced me to Kim Vandiver the Dean of
Undergraduate Engineering - he got his students involved in the plastic
thatch project.

Yes- I do think that I have been able to accomplish a huge amount in a
short time- this is because I have been working on these projects for
nearly 20 years with almost NO funding. It was amazing to have a little
bit of money to make things happen. I was able to find people with
incredible skills and great enthusiasm for these projects. In under a
week I was able to find a man in Quito that not only could understand
what I had drawn but who was able to make one of my machines. Since I
had NCIIA funds - I was able to pay him in a timely fashion and he made
my proto-type in a matter of a month or so. If I had been able to stay
in Quito longer - we could have made the first proto-type in a few days.

I have a whole notebook full of ideas for improved bio-diesel process,
to improved cacao processing, to a whole aquaculture sustainable fish
production and processing  lay-out - all I need is a little time! (Oh
yeah and a really cool idea about a low-energy ecological canopy tour (a
gravity powered chair-lift for viewing tropical forest canopy - but that
project would cost $.25 million -rough estimate...any ideas;)) !)

Cheers - David

2) they hope to ID 2-3 for licensing purposes (they are looking for promising ones that match up with diseases common in TZ)
3) They will hold an entrepreneurial workshop in Tanzania in June to bring industry and the University of Dar Es Salam together and brief everyone on results to date and try to get industry interested in future licensing opps.
4) They are working with 10 universities in Africa, hoping to transfer their screening technology to other scientists.

A brief up-date. I have been in contact with Lupi Montoya from RPI - we
hope to collaborate next in the Spring.

I am headed back to Ecuador on the last of the NCIIA funds! The MIT group
was a bust - they could not do what I wanted and ended up with a variation
of something I tried several years ago: a plastic sheeting made from the
plastic bottles. I also found out that this concept is already in use in
Brazil - very disappointed, but they are senior college students - so what
should I have expected??!

While I am in Ecuador I have plans to complete the proto-types and get a
batch of thatch ready for testing. My collaborator in Ecuador has just
completed a new building with classrooms and a lab (Ilya Raskin is sending
a team that will be the first to work in our laboratory) - we are going to
try the plastic thatch on this building. These next 10 days will be very
intense!

1003851,2008-02-11,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"What they've done so far:
-set up communication between RPI and Peru
-visited last August. Went to rural village near Cuzco with Ursula.
Saw two needs: water and energy for heating

1-small room to house guinea pigs (energy efficient). Noticed kids with runny noses and respiratory disease. Guinea pigs now live in kitchens and also there is pollution with dung stoves.

2-dairy cooperative. Need for clean water and some energy. Help them produce more and move towards certification. Want income generating project for clean water.  Ursula is getting more information on this.

3- air quality problem. 

-got funding from Mondialago to build a demonstration house (for people) designed by RPI, someone willing to donate land

Some of the original ideas not relevant...this is what the people need.
PW: where's the technology?
Lupita - I'm not a business person - need to talk to Rob Chernow.

Want them to become more self-sustaining. 
Outcome: model that people can implement in their own home. Demonstration project but also someone to provide credit and someone who is going to manufacture this...

PW: get a better understanding re what the approach for dissemination, regardless of what project they choose. What's the economic model 

Thought they were going to pick a project that Grupo was supporting, improve it, work with NESST or others to disseminate ...so they are starting at a much earlier stage. 

What's the economic pressure that's going to drive people to want/buy this? (Those with demonstration projects have stuff but their neighbors don't have it).

Ultimately, their end goal is similar to NCIIA - income generation, locally owned enterprises.
Don't want to dictate the technological innovation, we don't know anything about guinea pigs. General objective - ag productivity.

NCIIA wants to understand economic sustainability. Who's the partner?

Next steps: come to workshop, set up call with Rob Chernow and Phil. Select projects. Focus on economic sustainability. 

Second goal is to institutionalize / making change at RPI - making progress there. Need to decide which kids to come down to Peru next summer.

Lupita is meeting with Smith 2/22 but Phil and I will be away. jkj

moving to Duquesne. Have a machine that works to strip plastic off bottles.  And designed a binding machine for the plastic thatch. Built a biodeisel production facility - but process is very corrosive. Shorter term 3 projects: designed and selling tours for ecotourists - carbon friendly (picture) frames. Coffee tour - tourists go through a coffee tour and take a small packet of coffee, same with chocolate bars. These short term projects are quick revenue generators to help implement resource generation for the overall area. Create enough sustainable enterprises to demonstrate that conservation of these areas is worth it. Connected to each of these tours, epostcards -

Jennifer and Rachel,

I prepared a proposed revised budget for my Sustainable Visions grant (Grant # 3851-06).  I have basically created a new budget item for undergraduate student support.  I essentially moved $4000 from the Materials and Supplies budget item to this new item.  I have two undergraduate students from my Introduction to Engineering Design class this semester that want to continue to work on their designs over the summer.  The project involves an improved biomass stove and a device for reformulating the biomass fuel.  Since we are hoping to implement these projects this summer in Langui, Peru, I am very interested in having them continue their work to refine the designs with the continued input from our collaborators from Grupo at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru. 

I am essentially asking for support for 2 students at half-time.  They are willing to find additional work in the area so that they can supplement their income while they work on their project.  They have just started to do some laboratory tests. This support will allow them to continue that work so that our implementation is better informed.  It will also give us more time to try some other alternatives for the fuel reformulation.

Please, let me know if you need further information from me.  I have told the students I need to get your approval before I can make a definite offer. I am attaching an Excel spreadsheet with the approved and proposed budget re-allocation.  I'll be happy to provide more descriptions if necessary. Just let me know.  Thank you in advance.

1003804,2008-06-17,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"UPDATE from Tom's summer trip to Kenya: Tom traveled to Kenya to check on the low cost entrepreneurial efforts. Demonstration sites of appropriate technology. Training and entrepreneurial activities, almost like an incubator. Bringing in training resources. People are hungry to provide skills to students.
Downside - lack of accountabiiity from foreign partners/2 universities (U of Moi and U of Nairobi) have designed water well utility rig and rock crusher - designed but not built. Faculty and students had been killed and fled/delay. 
Don't really know how to motivate them -U of Nairobi hasn't even requested the funds to build a prototype. Lots of excuses, blamed the students. Not a team approach: faculty assigns students. Students did presentations on the work that they've done and they will start construction next semester. (May be British system). Met with Alan Spivey from Kickstart - it costs $14k to drill a well, right now everything is done by hand and the water is impaired. Alan said low cost low powered drilling system would be most beneficial thing to focus on (but how do you get through igneious rock with a low powered engine?) as well as a plow and a cart to carry it arround. Sisal decorticator is limited to Eastern side of the country and there are accessible mills. Tom said that maybe it wasn't the farmers they should have talked to...entrepreneurs will buy the well digger, not the farmers. They (Alan who is in charge of product development) seemed interested in partnering with Penn State as a low cost research arm... Martin and others seem to only want to work with Stanford and IDEO. Tom is open to Alan's offer as a first step since real life problems are everything and Tom feels like he needs to prove himself/provide value. Overall, not on track re where he expected to be, but there is some traction - he stressed deadlines and met a third university. Flow of $, academic calendars are a factor. 
A third university JomoKenyatta has a base power unit developed - could be a stronger partner. Younger faculty with entrepreneurial spirit. By December, waterwell drilling rig, rock crusher, plow and cart will be constructed then field tested. Beyond that, much relies on Kickstart and the partnership that may develop  - if the product is good, they would spend their marketing, distribution and sales forces to promote the product. Tom feels like all the eggs would be in one basket. U of Nairobi could fabricate and market and sell. Would like to see jobs created (but Kickstart outsources to China!!)

Hello!  I hope this finds you well.  I know that we already sent you some photos related to our sustainable vision grant, but I wanted to include a few more that I recently received from our community partner in Cameroon.  The group that we originally started working with in Nkuv has already completed two new filter projects in different communities and getting ready to start a third.  They are receiving external funding from an international organization (Thirst Relief International), but all of the operations are taken care of locally.  I think they are on there way to something great!  Anyway, the photos just highlight what the ""community-based"" biosand filter model looks like.  We are hoping to fill in the details with our paper/presentation at the upcoming NCIIA conference.

I am at the Academy of Management - I gave a presentation based on some of the work I was able to accomplish through the generousity of NCIIA. I am of course disappointed that NCIIA and I have not found a way to continue our collaboration. I am indeed a bit perplexed - my work seems to exemplify the type of thing NCIIA symbolizes. I have taken an idea, created a working prototype - and built it in the underserved community, I have created a potential business model and I have networked extensively - all the while including students in the processes. I am really not sure why I have not been able to get more funding to finish what NCIIA has allowed me to start. 

As a junior faculty member it is very difficult to find the funds and the time to do this kind of innovation - it seems an odd waste of resources to deny resources for a project that has moved so quickly and yeilded results for the students involved, the community members involved and in addressing a critical waste/resource issue. I am certain that I will find other funders, but I am disheartened by the waste of time and effort that this will require. My biggest issue is that I have so little time - the funds bought me time that has yeilded advances that have been waiting for years to burst forth. I have ten other ideas that are just waiting for the time and resources to enact - now I am back to waiting for funds. This is tragic.

1003763,2008-09-05,Rachel Agoglia,"Phone call w/ Phil, Robyn, and Bernard on 9/5/08 regarding the new direction of the grant: Bernard noted that the last payment was received at the end of June, and they'd like to request an extension. They have $21,500 left.
Progress thus far:
Bernard shared that he faced a lot of corruption when trying to complete goals of original proposal. 
Held a workshop on solar energy, 25 students attended (young entrepreneurs, some affiliated w/ university, others not).  Creation of a ""green"" carpets initiative: grad student researched how carpets are made, and how to create them using green methods.  Wrote master's thesis on this, they will send to us. 
New Idea: There is no wood in Afghanistan for carpeting, and for people in general for heating.  Technology Bernard came across, that involves mixing sawdust and paper, compressed, to create Briquettes to provide cooking and heating fuel. 5 briquettes can provide fuel for a family of 5 for one day. 
They have started a business in Kabul to make the briquettes (employing children who were in prostitution rings) and 5 handicapped young men. They are producing about 1000 briquettes a day, they want to expand this to a bigger business to employ more like 5000 children.  Plenty of material to create the briquettes, they have bakeries interested in using them, which would reduce the cost of bread by 40%
They also want to educate the children who work in the factory - make briquettes in AM, in PM learn up to 5th grade (2-3 hrs per day). 
They proposed using remaining funds to to build a classroom, market the briquettes, and pay teachers.  This new project could benefit local people, 
carpet industry, bread industry, potters. They have also has received a grant from a private donor to work on this project.

Phil's response: different use of funds, but still fits w/ the grant guidelines - would be helpful for us to have more real time notice of how things had changed for them.  Need to hear about dramatic changes earlier on. 
But, new work is exciting - agrees to use of remainder of the funds, but guidelines wouldn't support paying a teacher - what makes sense w/ program guidelines would be to use funds for furthering the development and scaling of the business.  

NEXT STEPS: Phil asked for an update on what was described verbally in writing, and a brief rationale of why briquettes.  They will formally request the extension, as well as create a general work plan and a proposed budget for the project. Bernard said he'd send this the week of 9/8/08. l
on the project. 

Phil also mentioned the new initiative (DR 100) we're going to launch this fall - looking a developing a network of faculty innovators who are working on addressing issues of poverty in the developing world - want to support the expansion of activities - core gp of people are assembling, to help us think about how to do this and what kind of issues/constraints. 100 schools involved in doing curricular work in which students are engaged on and learning about the process of engaging ways to help people out of poverty. Bernard is very interested, and also felt the National Academy of Engineering could be interested - he'd like to connect Phil with NAE to discuss.

Then a grass roof - doesn't work with 2 chimneys (Grupo says they last 4 yrs but Lupita saw that the locals don't want it and there are no skilled workmen to keep up the roof. They didn't use the RPI design - Grupo used its own design. Lupita then decided that even the RPI model / design was not ideal - talked with local women. Wanted the fumes from the stove to be minimized. Storms also delayed the project. 
So - disconnect between Grupo and RPI and local people not listened to. Lupita interviewed women and took measurements of soot. The dung is kept in the kitchen - Grupo didn't know this. (New person at Grupo). 
Need to put on a new roof. Need to get an estimate of $ remaining. Install the stoves, which will be built locally by a stove maker with instructions from RPI. Post demonstration - Grupo will take it from there - business development. (Ken Schug from IIT might also bring groups). Individuals can then start a business with the help of a local ngo (IEA?) or NEsST. In the meantime, a family would actually live in the demonstration house to test it and prevent vandalism. I asked Lupita for a statement of support from Grupo with a plan for how they would support the development of businesses that come from this.  Agreed to give Lupita a six month extension.

Dear Jennifer:

I hope all is well!

Just wanted to update you on our project in Tanzania ---Enabling Pharmaceutical BioExploration in Tanzania. Our partners have advanced the plant collection and STN screening program reasonably well since our Entrepreneurial Workshop last June. To date 111 plant species have been collected and screened for therapeutic properties. We still have quite some way to go to accomplish our target of 300 plant species but our colleagues are eager to continue the work after having learned from and overcome the initial problems they faced in executing the project. They now have three students permanently dedicated to the project and are processing the government permit that will allow the students and all others associated with the project unimpeded access to all the ecosystems they would like to sample around the country.

We support their request for a no-cost extension to enable them meet the target of 300 plant species set in the proposal and hope you would oblige the favor. As at this point am unable to say categorically how many months extension our colleagues need to accomplish the work. I have just sent an email to confirm and will communicate this to you as soon as I hear from them.

We also would like to know at what point we could develop another proposal to expand the current project. We have seen sufficient excitement in the results collected so far and the commitment of our partners to believe in the prospects of the project in future pharmaceutical bioexploration in that part of the world..

Please let me know your thoughts on these issues. If you have any questions, we would be delighted to answer.

In other words, how will others who want and need the filters get them? (And the training too of course). Are there any local champions who see a business in this? It seems like you are meeting a real need and I'm sure you want to see more people benefit. What will it take to make that happen?

Some materials were left in the village for the second round of filters, the third round (most current and by far the largest) Thirst Relief International provided the funding for the filters. The Thirst Relief grant was obtained solely by the national NGO and the village. We did not write or administer this grant.

Hello Jennifer:

Sorry for the delay in responding.  I wanted to receive comment from the various parties involved in Kenya before writing.  The current status regarding university participation on the ag. utility project is as follows:
 
1.  University of Nairobi - the Briggs and Stratton engine was received with much fanfare in January, and that was about all that UoN has undertaken.  They have not even requested access to their $15k subcontract for the construction of the base power unit, nor for the agreed upon attachments.  This relationship has been the basis for our work in Kenya to date.  A faculty member, Madara Ogot, was here at Penn State and a native of Kenya.  He had/has extensive contacts throughout Kenya.  I believe I mentioned, two Decembers ago, with one day's notice, he departed to be employed by UoN's technology-transfer/business development arm - and no one has heard from him since!  Even during our visit there in June, we could not track him down.  :(    The internal politics at UoN are mysterious and volatile.  The primary design faculty member does correspond, but nothing ever gets done (although they did design/construct a manual rock crushing unit).
 
2.  Moi University - the B&S engine was delivered, they designed and built a manual water well drilling apparatus, and has spent the past 5 months trying to ""work through the bureaucracy"" of accessing the funds.  $11.6k was forwarded to them to construct the base power unit and assorted attachments.  They have not built the base power unit nor associate attachments.  The primary faculty responsible for the design keeps in touch, but continually reports that the bureaucracy prevents anything from happening.
 
3.  JKUAT - hopes are higher for JKUAT due to the meeting of administrators, faculty - the energy and aggressive nature of those involved, the outreach and extension programs in place, and several Penn State graduates who are Kenyan natives and employed by the university.  We hope to have JKUAT construct the base power unit as well as the attachments designed and constructed at Penn State, and several additional attachments.  In addition, the university has a business incubator we could access.  A discussion point was to explore incorporating the manufacturing component of the utility system with a new project we are working with JKUAT on - a sustainable village - located in Nyeri (180 km north of Nairobi). 
 
4.  Alan Spybey was adament - what is needed is a low-cost, portable water well drilling rig which can penetrate the igneous rock layers.  Currently, on $14k and a large, rotary drilling rig can do that.  This seems to be more of a research effort than a business development effort.
 
So, UoN has OK'd the release of the $15k for their subcontract.  Moi continues to 'explore' what must be done to release those funds back to us - to enable us to direct them to JKUAT.  As I mentioned, Moi has been forwarded $11.6k with the remainder of the $15k still encumbered here at Penn State.  What I would like to do is when Moi confirms release of the $11.6k is to task JKUAT with the construction of the already designed base power unit, water well drilling rig, cart, and yet to be designed plow, and several other attachments, and have them complete those by February.  In our discussions, that was a timeline agreeable to JKUAT.  The business plan was developed in the spring....and exploration of the incubator for manufacturing will be undertaken with JKUAT.
 
Thanks Jennifer!

1003804,2009-01-05,Rachel Agoglia,"Tom Colledge requested an extension until December, 2009.  Here are details:
As I mentioned in an earlier correspondence, the two universities we have partnered with on this effort (University of Nairobi and Moi University) have been sent formal letters to end their participation on the project due to their lack of communication and participation.  Once their signed letters of acknowledgement are received, we then seek to have another formal agreement signed with Jomo Kenyatta University of Agricultural and Technology (JKUAT).  JKUAT will serve as our partner then to collaboratively design/build the ag. utility system (they already have prototypes) as well as begin implementation of the business plan developed.  It would be best to have a fabrication facility in place.  Given that KickStart now outsources their money-maker pumps manufacturing to China, we need a home for such fabrication.    Toward that end, I would like to expand our current partnership with JKUAT on the eco-village design we are engaged with, to include as an entrepreneurial component for the manufacture of the ag. utility system.

Due to both factors listed above, I would like to request an extension on this grant til fall, 2009 (December) - to permit the partnership to be formalized with JKUAT as well as the business development in conjunction with the eco-village to consolidate.  Is this possible?

Here is the Sustainability Plan that Grupo-PUCP prepared for our Sustainable Visions grant. In addition to working through the RAMP Peru project as proposed, I am investigating other possible ways to move these products to market.  For example, I talked with Jean Howard at RPI's Severino Center about involving the Business School on this through MBA projects, and she really liked the idea.  I will be happy to report on that as we firm up a plan.  I am also considering a microfinancing NGO that may be able to help us in Langui, since they already do some work in Peru.

I'm also happy to report that we have one of the student clubs, ESW (Engineers for a Sustainable World) actively pursuing ways to continue working in Langui, which was one of our planned outcomes. I am now trying to determine the balance on the budget after all the reimbursements were finally processed by RPI, so that I can best help them move forward.

Finally, I am coming to the NCIIA mtg in DC this March. Ursula Harman is also trying to come and has asked me about travel funds available.  As far as I know, we have used all of our travel funds; however, we had moved some funds to support an undergraduate student over the summer to do research.  As it turns out, the student who did the work decided not to be paid (yes, you heard right). He asked me to keep the funding for the project and refused to be paid for his work.

He can't come to our conference this year but he's agreed to come next year and tell his story (we need to book him early).

Spring 2006 we funded the SV grant  - he had raised some other grant $, hired a programmer, built barcode scanning tools. Worked on rating products, built a team on campus - health scientists, social scientists. Built a couple of prototypes - take a picture of a barcode and send it to your phone while you're in the store. 

Built it to work on Nokia phone (largest seller of handsets in the world). Then went to meet with Nokia and cell phone carriers - they are mini monopolies. Cingular (now merged with ATT) said we'd love to get this tool on our phones but he had to apply to their program and wait 18-24 months to get approval. Will be irrelevant in 2 years! Total nightmare. He felt blocked by carriers.

Then the world changed...
This world has now busted open due to google and apple - allowing apps. Dara realized he needed to develop a free app on itunes and use it on iphone. Don't need permission from cell phone companies. Google has done the same for G1 Android phone.
So refocused on building for iphone and android. Even though it's smaller #, it's the way to go.

Got other small grants and went back to the funders but they didn't want this to be a small Berkeley research project. Wanted it to be out in the world and influencing the market. (The Funders Network for Sustainable Production and Consumption - affinity group run out of Environmental Grantmakers in NY) said we love it so much we don't want to fund you anymore. Get it off campus and make it a stand alone company.  Wanted it to become sustainable.

Funders Network introduced him to cleantech / social venture space/people in Bay area. 
Dara  ""I'm not a business guy - I want to give it away for free.""

Fall 2007 spun it off campus - raised $ from social angel investors - licensed some of the IP (had filed a patent). Created a For benefit  (B Corporation) corporate company. Incorporated in NY state, which allows you to become a for benefit (not possible in CA or DE) - clear triple bottom line in articles of corporation - shall consider all the stakeholders (not just maximizing shareholder return).

Talked to a lawyer in Palo Alto to set this up. Created legal structures and mission and then went out to raise more $ from venture investors. Raised $3.6M total.  which has allowed them to hire F/T staff, including ebay and yahoo staff and scientists.  (Amazing that they invested when Dara hasn't figured out how to make $ yet).

44k from us, $150k from other foundations (spent all on grad students) to build the proof of concept.

Still early, don't want to claim success. gone from on campus experiment to a startup.

Feedback has been great - this should exist. We want to know this information. Other feedback: Too much like a database, can you make it simpler. I've got 15 seconds to decide what cereal to buy with a screaming toddler in the supermarket. 

Have divided the world into 3 spaces:

HEALTH - personal health and wellness - by far the #1 concern - household chemicals, shampoo, food, toys, things you put on your kids. This is easiest to assess/ scientific ingredients/carcinogens. 
ENVIRONMENTAL - pretty good metrics exist.
SOCIAL- most qualitative and debatable. Personal ethics. Trying to make a personalization tool  - do you care about animal testing, how a company treats its workers? Some don't care about labor rights. Enable a vegan filter for example - you will never see a product with animal testing. 

So far about 100,000 on mobile apps and 700k on the website have tested this so far - giving them great feedback. Several hundred thousand users per month, goal is millions.

Not sure how they will make $. Want to give it away for free. Would need to be something on the backend. Several cities have asked to license it so they can buy green. Institutional buyers are pressured to buy green - one possible revenue source. Everyone is going to Dara asking for data. Free to users but $ charge institutions? 

Goal - 10 seconds or less - everything they need to know about the product.

Every week there's a new scandal - poisonous meat, toys, product, salmonella etc. which is like free marketing for goodguide.

Thinks being in CA has made a huge difference. Not sure how economy will affect them but feels lucky they got investment when they did.

Two of his engineers went to work for goodguide  - didn't want people to drop out of school for this! Some are now back working on their phds, some interns, some students still involved. Everyone has equity in the company - even the dataprocessing person - went beyond B corp rules.

Diamond is now on staff in BME and is running the student/academic side of
WHIA as well as managing our GHT program.  

In case you want to track students:  Of the original students, Mike Hoaglin,
Reto Ansorge, and Ryan Bertram are still very involved, but both are now
full time on other pursuits (Ryan in consulting in Chicago, Reto is doing
his PhD in EE, Mike in UPenn med school).  All are willing to stay on the
project and are in communication with us.  Aaron Eifler is on an HHMI
research fellowship in Radiology at NU, Swati Gupta and Parmede Vakil plan
to continue at NU for a PhD in BME/Radiology, and Alex Leung is graduating
with his MS and looking for work in a global-health related area.  All of
these students have been to SA.  NCIIA partially funded last year's group
(Swati, Parmede, Reto, Alex, and Ryan).  

The program we initiated with NCIIA help is here
http://www.cight.northwestern.edu/education/ms_certificate_program.html and
WHIA was the demonstration project.  We have other projects going and have
recast the program a BME-Env. Engineering collaboration since so many health
problems go beyond medical devices (and we happen to have a terrific partner
in Prof. Kim Gray here at NU).  We'll be at 10 students next year and full
strength at 20 the following year, and that is much a result of NCIIA
support as WHIA. 

Hope this helps.

---
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Well, Bill, I think there are two things that are new. One is that life cycle assessment goes way beyond carbon footprint at any given point. For example, a glass bottle, a glass jar, they analyze that, its manufacturing, to 1,959 discreet steps.

At every step of the way there are myriad impacts on the environment, on health, on the people involved, and so on. So, first, we have a vaster sense, and a much more accurate sense, of really what the impact is. And the second thing is, and this is the big breakthrough, that information is now available to you and me while we're shopping. So that we can use it to make better decisions.

BILL MOYERS: How so?

DANIEL GOLEMAN: Well, there's a fabulous website. It's called GoodGuide. GoodGuide.com. And it summarizes, it draws on about 200 of these databases, and summarizes for us in, you know, ten points — ten is the best, one is the worst — how this product stacks up on its environmental health and social impacts compared to other products of its kind. What this does, Bill, is give us what's called radical transparency. Suddenly, you know, we've all vaguely known, things have carbon fingerprints. Now we can know exactly which is better.",Internal Note,Completed,Normal,00570000004VlXPAA0,Post Award Note--2009/05/26 Jillian Zeppa

Jennifer,

Yes, we will send pictures.  With regards to projects, we have several in the works. I mentioned the proposals that have been submitted but didn't give you much detail.  We (Grupo and I) have been trying to leverage the Ecological Home in Langui to increase the level and diversity of productive enterprises in the region, mostly agrobusinesses. However, Grupo has also started to pursue EcoTurism opportunities and there is one grant proposal submitted for those efforts. The fact that we have the home in Langui help us in many ways. I will talk to Ursula about preparing a short summary of our outcomes and near-future goals that build on the Sustainable Vision grant.

By the way, after much thought and pain, I (and my family) will be moving to Colorado.  My husband has secured a full professor position in the Aerospace Engineering department at UC Boulder. My position is ""in the works"", God willing. I have a colleague in the Environmental Engineering dept. there who has been trying to get me there and thinks that my work in Peru will be better valued and rewarded there.  I expect to be at RPI at least until Dec.'09, but my position is officially until Jun'11.  I may stay past January if necessary, but I hope that things at UC will be worked out by then.

I expect to continue my work in Peru regardless of my location and I have worked very hard to enable my students in ESW (and SHPE to a lesser extent due to internal conflicts) to continue projects there even if I am not here. I will make sure to keep you posted on my plans.

Good stuff!!!  :)    Frustrating in terms of logistical support....but the kids at the orphanage are amazing....worth all the efforts!   Also, I didn't get mugged this time...so that is great!
 
Prior to departing for Kenya in mid-May, I forwarded the pertinent info to the financial administrator here in engineering about the de-obligation of UoN.  She had requested an email indicating NCIIA was OK with the deobligation AND that the funds could be transferred to JKUAT.  I did that....but she has been on vacation apparently......due back next week.  The email I provided her was the one where you indicated that you were OK with such a transfer.
 
The village concept (infrastructure, education/training, microentrepreneurship, agriculture) is well received by all involved.  The first business efforts will be ag. related - contracts with horticulture interests in the area, high tunnel w/ drip irrigation for out of season harvesting, etc.  The first 'production' efforts will be the biodiesel-fueled steam engine-generator and the second will be the water well drilling rig.  The good news is that both JKUAT and Moi University are now corresponding!!!!!.......interested......and seemingly enthused!   So we move forward.
 
When the woman in the dean's office comes in next week, I will confirm that all is well with the transfer to JKUAT.

I may even stay here past that date, depending on various factors (e.g., I'm trying to graduate one student before I go).

I hope you are enjoying the summer.
 
The agricultural utility system was to have consisted of the following:
 
1.  Base power unit
2.  Attachments:
     a.  water well drilling rig
     b.  decorticator
     c.  cart
     d.  plow
     e.  generator
      f.  rock crusher
 
Based on the discussions with KickStart representatives, and given that both Moi University and the University of Nairobi completely dropped the ball on the project, it was decided that the effort instead should focus on the development of the water well drilling rig - and related business opportunities.    
 
What I have attached are photos and videos of a couple of the initial efforts for the ag. utility system - the water well drilling rig (small scale percussion) and the rock crusher.  Is this the sort of thing you are seeking? - given that the thrust of the effort has moved to the water well drilling rig alone?  There are photos of the cart which was completed also, but the students took them with their cell phones and the quality is not good.

See attached photos.
 
 
As I mentioned in the last update, FINALLY we have the universities on-board to participate in the drilling rig effort.  Both Moi University and Jomo Kenyatta University (JKUAT) are in contact with us and responding.  We begin in August on the system and will be collaborating fall semester.  It will be necessary to request an extension on this effort as the business plan for the drilling rig is to be undertaken spring semester, 2010. 
 
Lastly, you sent an email months ago indicating it was appropriate to transfer the funds from the University of Nairobi to JKUAT for the project.  The research office is requesting another email which is more specific about that - that is, being a bit more explicit that it is approved to have the funds transferred from UoN to JKUAT.  An email would be adequate.
 
Thanks Jennifer.  Let me know if you have questions and such.

Hi Jennifer,
Thanks very much for the follow-up note on our grant.  It's good to hear from you.  All is well here and we had another very successful trip to Cameroon this past May.  The filters have certainly settled in in Nkuv and we received a lot of positive feedback (both quantitative and qualitative).  I spoke with Peter quite a bit about what the next step should be, but we really haven't come to any firm conclusions.  The model that seems to be working well for him is essentially organizing and managing these small scale community-based biosand filter projects using funding from another organization (Thirst Relief International).  I discussed with him at great length the need to create an organization that could function without this input of outside resources, but he remains skeptical about the ability/willingness of rural communities to finance these projects independently.  So I think I really need to either push him a little harder for some more creativity or perhaps try to initiate something with another organization.  I will keep you posted.

Attached is our latest version of the BSF Program Manual.  I am still calling it a draft, but I believe it is now essentially complete.

I will get in touch with Peter early next week and try to get a sense for what the next step should be.  Thanks again for checking in, and I will be in touch.

And thanks for the encouragement! My reply: thanks a lot, Jeff. One next step could be for you and Peter to attend an Advanced Invention to Venture workshop (4 days - see attached brochure). We just did our first one with a BoP focus and are planning 2 more for the coming academic year. It would be a great opportunity to spend 4 days thinking about and developing a self-sustaining business model. Grantees get a $1500 stipend to attend (per team, so you'd probably spend most of it bringing Peter from Cameroon). Let me know what you think about that idea - we are not pushing for profit vs. non profit, we just want to (like you) see impact on a large scale...Let me know if you're interested.

I wanted to write to provide you with an update on the status of the Agricultural Utilities System project – which evolved into the water well drilling project.  The summary follows:

As you will recall, the objectives for spring semester 2010 were as follows:

a. redesign, construct and test the engine/power train to reduce costs and increase portability

b. redesign, construct and test the drilling rig to permit easier removal of debris as well as the addition of enhanced safety features – with testing to be accomplished specifically on ‘hard’ Kenyan igneous rock.

c.  complete the business plan for the water well drilling fabrication business.

This past semester (Spring 2010) saw the third iteration of the engine/power train successfully completed along with the development of the full business plan for the effort.  These were undertaken in collaboration with the JKUAT students and faculty with field surveys completed.  Thus, two of the goals listed above have been completed.  Unfortunately, the re-design, construction and testing of the drilling rig apparatus as proposed by the JKUAT students/faculty was not undertaken.  Recall that this part of the system was designed, constructed and tested on ‘soft’ rock at Penn State over the past couple years. It is operational.  However, the goal for this past semester was to have the JKUAT students construct the drilling rig apparatus in Kenya to enable testing on the ‘hard’ igneous rock there.  Attempting to move forward on this with JKUAT has been less of a struggle when compared with the University of Nairobi and Moi University – but still a struggle.  JKUAT closed its campus a month early – ending at the end of March for unknown reasons.  They were not able to construct the drilling rig system and associated power train system.  They did, however, inform me that they intend to begin this construction effort mid-May.  I have not heard from them over the past month despite repeated emails to them. 

Given the above, I would like to request the following schedule be considered:

1.        Summer 2010 – JKUAT complete the fabrication and testing of the engine/power train system and the drilling rig apparatus.  In my last correspondence with JKUAT faculty, they agreed to accomplish this.  Testing of these systems is to be completed by August.  This is imperative in order to test the systems on the Kenyan rock layers.
2.       Fall 2010 – based on the results of the testing in August, another design iteration will take place on the drilling rig system itself – with additional field testing completed by December, 2010.
3.       Spring 2011 – assuming successful re-design efforts, fabrication efforts will be scaled up and hopefully sale of the units may commence April 2011 in accordance with the business plan.

This schedule will require an extension of the current contract.  Is that something that is possible?  I apologize for the continuing extensions on this project – but the university partnerships have, as you know, proven difficult at best.

Let me know your thoughts please Jennifer.

Thank You!!

1003804,2010-06-10,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Response to request for NCE:  Hi Tom,

Sorry to hear about your dad and the ongoing issues which must consume your time and energy. So hard on everyone.

Thanks for the update on the project; I can read your frustration between the lines. I'm disappointed that the switch in partners has not been as smooth as you had hoped. We'll be glad to extend the grant, if you believe that JKUAT will come through eventually. You seem to be willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.

Two questions: 

-Currently the grant ends Aug. 31, 2010 - is a one year extension enough?
-Can you expand on your plans if the design and testing is successful? Who is going to manufacture, sell and distribute?
""fabrication efforts will be scaled up and hopefully sale of the units may commence April 2011 in accordance with the business plan.""

I recently returned from a trip to Peru where the project is still searching for viable partners, so I do understand what you are up against. Regards, Jennifer

Thank you for completing the final report on 9/16/10 for the Sustainable Vision grant which ended Dec. 1, 2007.  I've had a chance to review the report and was frankly disappointed in the lack of progress against the original goals. (It sounded like you were disappointed too). 

Based on your report, the focus of the grant activities appeared to be on one school (INCAE)  instead of the eight schools in the SUMAQ alliance as proposed*. There seemed to be some limited success at INCAE (you noted you were able to transform one entrepreneurship class into more of a workshop, but did not achieve any commercialization/entrepreneurial goals or institutionalization of a program with additional funding etc.). 

1) My question is what attempts were made with the other 7 schools to share curricula and program development? I did not see anything about this in the report and want to give you a chance to provide further information; specifically, can you please elaborate on what happened to shrink the focus of the grant to one school or was that not the case?

2) Second,  I have questions with regard to the final expenditure report sent to NCIIA from MIT (attached), it is difficult for me to interpret/compare the line items to the originally approved budget (also attached). For example, we approved $20k in faculty stipend but it appears only $4,073.27 was spent for ""salary and wages."" The MIT report shows $30,599.36 in materials and services - which line item(s) does this correspond to in our approved budget? We need MIT to provide a budget that compares each approved line item vs. actual spent, using the same categories (Faculty stipend, technical and coordination support (sumaq), website development, student stipends and overhead otherwise it is impossible to reconcile. Should I pursue this with you or Priscilla Cassie at MIT (whom I know from other MIT grants)? If I don't hear from you this week, I'll contact Priscilla for more information.

Quite a long time! Hope all is well!

Last month we submitted online our final report on the Tanzania project. We wish to thank NCIIA for sponsoring the project and the opportunity to extend the deadline a couple of times. We are trusting that NCIIA understand those challenges that made it impossible to conclude the project as scheduled. 
Kindly advise on NCIIA's interest to support future efforts on our bioexploration work in Tanzania. We are also eager to extend the STN/BBD tech transfer to other African countries to expand the scope of bioactive compound discovery for the management of infectious diseases in Africa and elsewhere around the world.. Such efforts have significant potential for promoting the development of natural product-based medicines from Africa's biodiversity.

The Tanzanian project allowed us to cultivate the interest of some major biopharmaceutical companies in the US that are enthusiastic in working with us in the registration and development phases of product commercialization. We hope NCIIA would be interested in continuing the highly cherished support given to the Tanzanian project and more, so we can move forward in our product discovery efforts.

If interested, we would be delighted to submit a followup proposal for your consideration.

With kind regards, Albert

Part of this was a trip by MIT students to a poor coffee growing area to obtain initial validation of proposed new services and products. The same trip served to mix the INCAE and MIT students, to present MIT student ideas for companies to INCAE student, and to let some of the MIT entrepreneurship `ethos' rub off. To facilitate the discussion we had the teams produce short videos of their ideas.

For the comm-connect area, this is still being developed but already has significant traction, and with support of Google.org is being deployed in Haiti to help NGOs. It is also being deployed by the World Economic Forum to help manage their annual meeting in Davos. The SurfMobile team tried but never made it commercially.

You have made a lot of progress on screening, despite the very real challenges you mentioned. On the technical and educational fronts, I think you've reached many of your objectives; on the other hand I can see you're still a ways off from commercialization.

1003824,2011-04-22,Emily Hodos,"Emails between Matt and JKJ in Nov 2010: Phil Weilerstein and I are at a conference (Frontiers in Education) presenting the paper we wrote that includes the Digital xray/WHITIA project. We are presenting tomorrow and 2 questions have come up:


-how do the grad students pay to go to S. Africa - is it all grant funding or are there other mechanisms?
MS students travel and associated costs (prototyping, adjunct faculty, site visits) are funded primarily through a tuition return plan that is complicated, but essentially provides ~$12K/student in the program.  We also now have an NSF grant to cover some costs.


-were students involved in setting up WHITIA? Any students working there now?

Yes, the main force behind WHITIA was Mike Hoaglin, who started as an UG.  He's now at Penn in med school after working for Accenture for a few years.  As a student he's still active as ""Change Agent-Policy Analyst for Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (HHS), PENN Visionary Student Physician"" whatever that means.  The group that installed the first machine (Cross Roads Clinic, Cape Town) was Parmede Vakil (Now a PhD student, MRI, Northwestern), Swati Gupta (Alsoa PhD student in medical imaging), Ryan Bertram (working as a consultin Engineer) and (ops I'm blanining on his mame, but he;'s a med student at Wash U, I think).  Also Reto Ansorge, who was a PhD student in EECS who graduated and is now at a swiss company doing medical image analysis (he selected this career path because of the experience with the SA program).

And finally, how many students this year in the GHT master's program?

We have 9 BME's and another 3 in environmental.  I've attached the NSF grant application in case you want to see budget/curricular details.  Next year we are loing for 10 in each half of the program.

We've got some other things brewing as well, including another non-profit that is really a breakthrough in how Universities can manage humanitarian IP.  I'd love to have you come visit us sometime so we can show off what NCIIA's grant programs helped get off the ground.

Anyway, it seems like you have made lots of progress technically even though there is still testing to do, so I'm interested in learning what the path to market might be and who is driving this (CYEC? students or faculty from the university?)

No rush on a response, just wondered about this and didn't have time to follow up in the fall. Many thanks and hope to see you at our conference this year in SF, Jennifer

1003804,2012-04-19,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"discussion with Tom re moving forward - his gut is that he does want to try to get a third prototype finalized and tested and let Kobe (Andrew OKello) run with the commercialization. He's given up on JKUAT doing anything and they are the 3rd university partner. 

Tom, per our conversation this morning, NCIIA is willing to consider a final extension and a possible budget reallocation request for this grant. As we discussed, I would like to see: 

1) a letter from KOBE products outlining their interest in taking this forward with a work plan (with dates) and a description of what role each entity (JKUAT, Penn State and Kobe) will play in the plan
2) an explanation of who owns the IP or whether it is ""open source""
3) an updated budget that reflects funds spent to date (Emily will email you a template)
4) if you think it would be helpful, a letter from JKUAT outlining their role 
5) What is Kobe Products willing to invest/contribute if the remaining $7k in funds are released?

Finally, I think you agree that we should wrap this up by June 1 so if the above issues are addressed in writing by then we can move forward, otherwise we'll request the return of unspent funds. 

Please confirm that this accurately reflects our conversation. And thanks for your perseverance. Jennifer

We have rock samples coming from Kenya next week to have mining engineers test it and consideration for another iteration.  The JKUAT faculty/staff did not follow proper operational procedures during the last two operational tests.  This resulted in a poor test of drilling through the 'hard' rock layers.  This has been rectified through discussion once again.  Way forward:  rock layers tested to ensure drill bit is appropriate, modify their operational approach, and engage in the next iteration.
 
2.  CYEC is interested in serving as the owner, trainer and operator - so yes, they are the driver.  However, I think I wrote this in the progress report, the faculty member from JKUAT visited PSU last semester and made a pretty passionate presentation on the benefits of our involvement - altering their perspectives on teaching, etc. as well as the value of the project.  I would consider them a 'driver' as well, but not necessarily from a business perspective as is the case with CYEC.  CYEC is looking at this as an educational tool as well as a revenue source.
 
3.  I am sorry for attaching the entire business plan....but I did not feel the executive summary was adequate....thus, here is the entire business plan.  The JKUAT faculty/staff produced the drill rig at a lower cost than that accomplished by the PSU team - that is not reflected in these costs.

Tom, thanks for the final report on this Sustainable Vision grant; I appreciate your candor and hear the frustration on each page of the report. I think it was wise not to move forward (and share funding) with Kobe, given that the relationship was problematic on so many levels. I share your disappointment with the lack of partnerships and commercial outcomes. I do think you made some technical progress and perhaps the 33 students involved also benefited in some tangible ways (especially the finance students it seems?)

How long should NCIIA expect to wait for Penn State to ""un-encumber"" the remaining funds and should we do any follow up on our part. Those funds will go back into the pool for other grantees so again, appreciate you being conservative. 

Thank you for keeping me informed throughout the grant (proactively) and please know that I understand that your lack of success here was NOT for lack of trying. If another local champion appears and wants to take this on in the future, I'll be the first to applaud. I encourage you to share your lessons learned at future NCIIA conferences and elsewhere.

Happy Thanksgiving, Jennifer

Dear Jennifer,
Greetings from Hope College!  I just came across the attached photos while browsing facebook and thought they would be worth sharing with you.  As you may recall, the Sustainable Visions Grant that we were awarded by NCIIA back in the spring of 2007 was directed towards community-based training for household water filtration.  At that time, our in-country NGO counterpart, Life and Water Development Group - Cameroon (LWDG-C), was just getting established and our joint project in Nkuv, Cameroon, was their very first experience addressing water and sanitation issues.  Our primary intention throughout the grant period was to focus on training members of a very rural farming community on the ins and outs of household water filtration using an established technology (the Manz Biosand Filter).  LWDG-C was responsible for facilitating this process, but we later came to realize that their role as leaders and entrepreneurs was going to be the key ingredient if our efforts were ever going to extend beyond this one farming community.  I am very happy to report that, seven years after we first began working with LWDG-C, this group has gone on to have a very significant impact in communities all across the country.  Their most recent work has involved partnering with Guiness of Cameroon to organize and implement community scale water projects.  The attached photos give you a sense of the scale of this collaboration.  The sustainable vision grant from NCIIA played a huge part in supporting our initial efforts in Nkuv, but it also helped us to orient our program towards one of training and empowerment as opposed to delivery and aid.  I just thought it might be helpful for you and those who sponsor your efforts to see evidence that investments you are making in people and programs do (eventually) bear fruit.

Kind regards,
Jeff

Hi Allison,

Thanks for your follow up.

Based on the final financial report, I understand that the total amount of unspent funds is $16,580.08 (essentially, the same as your quote below). Of that amount, Penn State (PSU) is waiting on funds in the amount of $8,647.99 to be returned from Moi University (the ""encumbered"" funds) and should also have $7,932.09 immediately available for release to NCIIA.

I have a few questions about this:

1) Are there any concerns about Moi University returning funds to PSU in a timely manner? We ask this only because the PI has reported past challenges in the working relationship with the university over the course of the grant period.
2) Is there anything that NCIIA can do to assist PSU in receiving return funds from Moi University…. a letter, etc… If so, please let me know your thoughts on this.
3) If there is an expectation that funds will be delayed from Moi, is it possible for PSU to cut two separate checks - one immediately for $7932.09 and then a second one for $8,647.99 as soon as those funds are returned to PSU?",Internal Note,Completed,Normal,00570000004VlXPAA0,Post Award Note--2013/04/29 Emily Hodos

We are struggling to close this grant out before the end of our fiscal year June 30. As you know, the grant period ended a year ago and we've been trying to get Penn State to return the unspent funds which total $16,580.08 per your final expenditure report- see attached. Please see the email threads below between Emily (NCIIA) and Allison (Penn State) and you and I that started last fall and yet the issue has not been resolved. I am also copying Allison and just left her a voicemail message.

I'm getting some pressure from our CFO to get the entire amount of unspent funds returned by the end of June, since it's now been over a year since the grant ended. Any insight/recommendation on how to move forward would be appreciated. I know there is a history here with your former partners at Moi university, which is why I'm bringing you in this.

1003819,2014-11-13,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Eric met with Dara at UC Berkeley: Met with Dara O’Rourke of Goodguide.
They have spun out a Business: Business operation called “Premier"" which is the for-profit side of the company now. They basically get large store chains to choose products they will put on the shelf using Goodguide rating algorithm. So far working with Target, CVS and next week Walmart. They are leveraging the buying power of these chains to influence consumer behavior (if bad stuff isn't available, people cant buy it). This project is supported by UL (the stamp on your toaster) which is a consumer safety company trying to update its rating system. Dara continues teaching, being CEO, etc.
Goodguide never became profitable - none of the typical online business models (subscriptions, pay as you go, etc.) worked. They also couldn't be valid and take $$ from corporations they were rating, etc. So they are a nonprofit serving the public good.
Discussed the proposed rubric for E-Teams.  He said this is “complicated” and will only have people trying to improve their mousetrap. He suggests a process that has student teams thinking much more deeply and broadly about product design (e.g. instead of eliminating a toxic rain repellent for your jacket, use entirely different material that repels water). This could be a powerful part of training but is not a “simple checklist”  He also noted that giving people info about what to avoid is easy part - revolutionizing their ideas is tough. That said, we should SERIOUSLY rethink the idea of this rubric or tool so we don't inadvertently add to the problems. We are always encouraging our teams to “catch mice” not invent better mousetraps.
Discussed alumni network (what he would like, what he needs, etc.).  Dara indicated he’s never thought of himself as an NCIIA alumni, but clearly he is. He said it would be great to connect with other alum, but in a meaningful way.  For example, a retreat would be of no value unless we gave value (an opportunity to think strategically about the next three years of his business). There are “literally dozens” of e-ship events every day in SF and Silicon Valley… who has the time?!  That said, he does want to give back and feels he has important lessons to share.  (he’d be a great mentor) and is committed to continuing his work at Berkeley and writing on his experiences.
He’s super articulate, super interesting story - he might be a GREAT speaker for Sustainability Award…
