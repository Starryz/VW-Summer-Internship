I am happy to inform you that your request for an extension and budget reallocation of NCIIA grant #6843-09 has been approved. Attached is an electronic copy of the signed letter. The original letter will be mailed via USPS to you today.

While the reallocation was approved, both Phil Weilerstein and Jennifer Keller Jackson expressed some concern regarding the lack of a clear business plan. The report you submitted raises questions about what comes next, starting with where the $60k is coming from to pay Chris Halberg? As a result, Phil would like to schedule a call with you to find out what your thinking is and to strategize with you on possible next steps that can bring your project from the prototyping stages into the market.

Please provide some preferred times of availability to speak with Phil over the next two to three weeks, and I can get back to you with times that work for him.

1006843,2012-05-29,Emily Hodos,"Email from Lars on 5/14/12: 1)  Right now, it's over $100.  Our target price in the short term is $50.  Mara and Joseph, the consulting engineers, are cracker jacks at that and I think we will achieve that goal for sure.
2) Attached is a picture of our industrial design team's model of our latest case. [attached below]
3) We just talked with the leader of the health promotors at the Ministry here, this morning.  We envision an organization separate from the Ministry (they can't do manufacturing)  to build the HPNs.  The Ministry is an ideal first customer and will collaborate with us to test training programs (we discussed two big studies with them).  The specifics of our organizational plan will depend heavily on the analysis of supplies and labor that some MBA students from Kellogg and Marquette's business schools are going to do for us, but I speculate it will be a U.S. company in the beginning.  Whether it will be non-profit or for-profit also depends on market research.
4) We're working with colleagues from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  They are British doctors, Drs. Crampin and Khan, who run a TB testing program in Malawi.
5)  Next Breath is a company that does FDA clearance testing and case preparation for nebulizers.  They are a third party contractor who has agreed to help us get FDA clearance for the HPN at a greatly reduced price.  We are very grateful for that.

1006873,2011-09-13,Emily Hodos,"Call with JKJ & Elsa on 9/13/11:
Students involved in this project are very invested (they do not receive grades). Essentially, the entire project got delayed by one year (no trips, no financing, etc…). The students who were originally working on this project with funding that preceded NCIIA got great PR but did not document anything about their work or experience.  So the students that picked up on the project with NCIIA funding were essentially starting from scratch – had no history. In addition, original group of students left a mess in Africa and with bad feelings from those in the local community. 

Student went to Banda. Rwanda and established relationship with KIST who is helping on the technical side, including making translations of instructions. They have also teamed up with a UK-based NGO e.quinox whose strength is the business end and started by students with support of faculty at Imperial College.


When they visited Banda, initially discovered that site built in 2008 has quit working. Found that biz model was working, though. Another issue is that it wasn’t usable in the rainy season (too slippery) – only in dry season. Now rebuilding system and will also be building steps up this year for rainy season access. Students were discussing possibility this summer of mircogrid, but determined that this is not priority right now.

Where are they with the technology?
Have been working on building better turbine and power generating system – working on this in US. Set up model system in brook near Dartmouth to test. Installing this new system in Bhanda.

There is a second site with commercially-built product from Canada, purchased and being managed by Dartmouth students. Working well except that people are not properly charging batteries. It ends up that only the wealthy community members are using because they can afford to buy new batteries when old ones die from overcharging.

Considering if they will set up another site. So much depends on whom they can get to partner with.

This summer, students indicated to Elsa excitement about a local eco-tourism NGO in Banda. Later in summer, students have now made a connection with CARE. Not sure where these will go. 

Any sense on what a possible implementation path might be?
To make sure that Banda is a successful prototype in every respect. 

What is the vision? If the prototype in Banda works, what then? Who owns, who pays, etc…? Plan is to develop small franchise business model with one employee running it

Ted Sumers is the lead student.  Have also brought in a first year student this year so the project can continue on.

Notes: Part of leadership training at Dartmouth – to help understand that there has to be carry over from year to year. Funds are being matched at some level by Dartmouth. Elsa mentioned that grant is most helpful to African universities.

In terms of a sustainable business model for the tele-health project, we have come to the conclusion that the health insurance concept is too abstract and unfeasible to implement. We are now considering providing ancillary services to support the tele-health project. Based on conversations with the health workers in Nicaragua and members of our in-country team, we have come up with the following idea concepts:

* Small pharmacies for the rural communities - particularly those located far from the town
* Cell phone charging services (since each of the health workers is equipped with a solar powered cell phone charger)
* Texting services for ordering goods at stores in town (e.g. a pair of boots)
* Educational programs offered through the cell phones

THANK YOU for the interim report on socialite which I read this morning. So disappointing that the lecturer has dropped the ball, but these things happen. Clearly the demand is there and the technology works, so now it's the manufacturing, distribution and support hyrdra that must be wrestled with.

Permit me two follow up questions:

How many lanterns (not systems) have you sold/distributed so far? What's your estimate on # of people per household that benefit from the lantern. (eg Greenlight Planet in India sells to an average household size of 6). We are trying to determine the # of people who now have light as a result of the tech innovations we've supported...it's obviously a moving target.

Second, given the financials you sent, and the fact that you won't break even for a while, how much $$ are you looking to raise?

1006843,2011-06-28,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Phil - Notes from conversation today with Lars:

He did chat with Jose and got his input (Jose does not think clinical trials should be necessary for this device). I also mentioned D-REv's strategy of getting CE (european certification) instead of clinical trials for Brilliance as it's much cheaper and faster. Lars is still set on trying to do clinical trials in El Salvador this coming year; he feels invested in the relationship with the Ministry of Health and believes that they will not adopt this technology without clinical trials.

His student Chris has deferred med school for a year to run them - he's been on this project 18months and knows El Salvador players. Ministry of Health is a real partner - they are providing lots of in-kind support (doctors and patients will not be paid, they are providing some equipment too). Lars needs to raise $60k to pay Chris and expenses for the year of clinical trials - he has not succeeded in doing this yet, but has ""lots of fishing lines in the water."" They just attended the Global Health Summit in Atlanta and met folks from GE Healthcare, USAID etc. A no cost extension of the NCIIA grant would allow them to use the remaining travel funds etc.  He is convinced that if the clinical trials are successful the Ministry would pick this up and run with it. (It doesn't sound like he's thought in much detail beyond the clinical trials).

Plan B if he can't get clinical trials funded is another project in Malawi (that he's writing grants for) which uses the nebulizer to collect sputum samples for TB screening. Their first paper on this topic will be published in August.

Plan C is to do the trials in Rwanda with the Harvard Partners in Health clinic there. They are also willing to donate their Doc's time. Paul Farmer visited Marquette and is supportive. This project needs funding too....

So, bottom line is that Lars is stuck, in a holding pattern until he can raise more $$. He is looking for ideas and contacts...

1006843,2011-06-30,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"MORE INFO from Lars: I forgot to mention that.  When we talked with Mark Anderson at the Center for International Health (http://www.centerforinternationalhealth.org/), we discussed this.  The first step would be to set up an entity, either a 501 c3 or a for-profit social business. C4IH and GE could help us with that, he said.  There may be funds through the county or other entities to foster Milwaukee jobs, so our first manufacturing plant would be here in MIlwaukee.  It makes sense, there are a lot of medical manufacturers in the area.  I also would want a good handle on ISO and CE standards for these first units.  Another option would be to create a joint venture with an existing medical manufacturing company in the area.  There are a couple of good candidates with enough expertise.  I have good contacts at Gauthier medical and one of their senior staff was on one of the first HPN design teams.  

So, most likely some separate entity will be created, the first supply chain will be directly through the Ministry of Health of El Salvador, but for other entities, the Medshare model for distribution was offered to us by them.  I'm definitely intrigued by this maternova model, too.

I'm off to the lab to finish the day's experiments.  If you or Phil want to contact me, just leave a message on my cell (414) 334 3830.

The team is still as proposed:  Nick Edwards is chair, Derek Brand is vice chair and Manaure Rodriguez (commonly called Mana) is treasurer.  Andy Wong is also involved.  The team is working with several additional students who we are actively recruiting to join for the long-term. Derek is working with a team from U. of California, Berkeley, Haas School of Business to study the prospects for future businesses, based on the two successful pico-hydro projects that have been built today.  They have a contact from the World Wildlife Conservation Society to do this.  We are interfacing with them to provide the information to NCIIA to use as we move forward with our grant.

The team is still looking at possible project locations, but none has been decided firmly yet.  We are continuing to explore Rwanda as a place for further pico-hydro projects.  We have also been approached by an NGO in Cameroon about working jointly with them.  We have made contact with them, but are a bit concerned because they are a French-speaking country.  We will continue to explore this option.  We are continuing to study Uganda as having a promising geography, but have yet to make contact with an NGO there.  We have a project in Tanzania with contacts at the University of Dar Es Salaam, but we have not yet located a promising geographical site.  Finally, we have contacts at Lesotho that we are considering following up on.

In terms of program plan, we have had a bit of a set-back.  The drive shaft broke on one of the pico-hydro sites in  Rwanda.  Thus students this term have been re-designing the turbine.  The first step was to analyze and then reduce points of fracture.  They are receiving help from Prof. Schulson here at Thayer who is an expert on fracture of metals.  They have made a decision that the re-design will use bolted rather than welded joints.  The prototype will be built during spring term.  Also during spring term the students will make further investigation of and contact with additional sites.

At least three students will be going to Rwanda this summer.  They intend to spend two weeks at the initial site, overseeing installation and operation of the upgraded design.  Clearly this must happen before any further systems can be installed.  After the two weeks at the initial site, the students will spend between 6 and 8 weeks exploring other opportunities.  At the present time, the plans are to concentrate on other sites in Rwanda.  However, plans may change after the analysis that students will carry out this spring.

This should bring you up to date.

Charlie Sullivan and I are both planning to attend the Project Workshop in San Francisco.  I look forward to seeing you there.

Thanks for the update and I'm very glad to hear you've identified a team of students and some initial advisors.

I realize your business plan is not due for completion until 2011, but my guess is you'll have some clearer ideas after the summer trip to Rwanda. I'll add that deliverable to your grant file once you give me a date; in the meantime, we will move forward and process your award.

Also, while you're at the conference, I've invited Brian Thomas from Village Energy (Baylor) to dinner 3/34/10 and hopefully you two can connect - he's launched a micro-franchise model with hydroelectric power in Honduras and is a fellow (past) Sustainable Vision grantee.

We had a wonderful assessment trip to Nicaragua that included four electrical and computer engineering (ECE) students, two ECE faculty (Sarvesh and I), three nursing students and two Nursing faculty (Betty and Ruth) and three business students and one business faculty member (Jim Klingler) and a nursing student translator. It worked out very well and our partner in country (Tim Hansell) spent the whole week with us and is very excited about the project. We got to conduct interviews with health workers, visit the hospital and a home for housing pregnant women from remote villages in their last month of pregnancy (prior to delivering their babies in the hospital), visited health promoters in the field,  performed an assessment of cell phone coverage in the communities surrounding Waslala, and visited the main cell phone company around Waslala, Claro, who offered to give us as many cell phones and cell phone service plans as we need! I have a number of photographs from our trip on the following website:http://www.ece.villanova.edu/~singh/Pali's Nicaragua Photos/. Enjoy looking at the pictures!

Have a memo of understanding - they have agreed to share resources etc. Will teach them a course on research methodology to inform doctors and nurses how to perform research study and ensure quality research. Status in Waslala: several iterations of data formating, training health workers on reliable blood pressure measuring and reporting. Sounds like this has been difficult. EG: told them 180/60 is the ideal so the health workers try to get those results! Power reliability has been a problem too. During the rainy season power is out for days at a time. Idea is still to collect data, send it via cell phone into a database which a doctor monitors. In Dec. their main contact at the parish who connects to all the health workers left for another job in Managua. Replacement has no health experience (Sylvia). So personnel challenges. Also been reaching out to Engineering school in Managua and will be collaborating with them (UNI). Student came with them for translation and they are motivated to work with them. Also met with a nursing school - they just held a training workshop for health care workers (who are volunteers - this is an extension of their religious faith). Goal is to exit and have the locals run this. Healthcare is a govt run program. Can't figure out a sustainable business model but perhaps a govt sponsored program? Govt does provide regional hospitals but no support for health workers. Want to make sure the training and tools are in place so they can run it themselves. Govt DID seem excited about a relatively low cost program to reach out to rural areas. Power issue is to keep the computer running in the offices of the parish health program. Need $ to provide support to their partners - specifically the parish. One of his students is going to live down there for 6 months (service learning project) to monitor the infrastructure - make sure the data is collected, reported and software is working correctly. Right now Doctor has a smart phone and want to give her remote access to the database so she can check it. Got a lot of cell phones donated. Might also send another student to live there for a few months, she would ensure the workshops are running well and teaching correctly - eg hard to measure pulse rates is you don't know how to measure time. THIS IS NOT GOiNG TO BE A SUSTAINABLE PROJECT, but it might scale with govt support. Next steps: looking at another model in Nicaragua called NICASALUD supported by USAID. They might be interested in supporting this.

UPDATE FROM PALI: Let me start by giving you an update on the tele-health project. We now have 70 community health workers (CHW’s) in the Waslala region who have been brought into the program. The system is working well and we have a ministry of health nurse reviewing the health records and communicating with the health workers directly in emergency cases. We have another 17 more communities in the Waslala region that we need to bring into the program but those communities currently do not have viable health leaders. We are in the process of identifying individuals in these communities who would be capable and willing to serve as CHW’s and expect to bring them on board in March 2014. We have developed a very strong team in Waslala now comprising a program manager, an office manager, and four nurses on staff. We also have the local ministry of health involved and we have started to finally engage with the national ministry of health. In most recent trip in October, we also expanded the project to a new site, Villa El Carmen. We performed initial training of five new health leaders at this site last month. What was really cool was that we had two of our experienced health leaders from Waslala and one of our staff nurses travel down with us to Villa El Carmen and they helped to deliver the workshop! The main purpose of piloting a new site was to see what infrastructure support we were missing in trying to expand our program. It worked very well as we immediately identified the infrastructure gaps in the new site that we need to fill. Another cool thing that happened in October was that we checked with our team in Waslala as to when they think they could take over the complete management of the program in Waslala. They indicated that in another year, they could confidently take over managing the program in Waslala – I was very pleased to hear that since we ultimately want local ownership of the program. We now have them working on long term sustainability plans! We are now working to start national scale up of the program and are in the process of applying for funding to help achieve that goal (as well as seriously working on sustainable business models). It’s all  very exciting!!

1006878,2010-02-25,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"NAME CHANGE: 
This is a somewhat belated heads up on a name change for the incubator.  Rather than sustainable venture accelerator, we are going to call it New Economy Venture Accelerator (NEVA).  This is only a cosmetic change.  The stimulus for this was a request we received from Washington for a proposal to fund initiatives that might contribute to jobs in Colorado.   Our incubator became the centerpiece of the concept, but we were concerned that the term ‘sustainable’ would not help us with the donor.  As you know, that is a charged word that many embrace but that others turn their noses up at.  So we just made the change, thinking that NEVA has a better ring to it for a broader audience.  New Economy, from our perspective, is one in which businesses must build strategies that include environmental and social outcomes in their model in order to excel. 
 
I’ll let you know what happens to that proposal.  It is for around $3 million  for three years, with the lion’s share being for an investment fund for ventures.  We feel it’s got maybe a 20% chance of funding, and should know if it moves to the appropriations process very shortly.

-what were the challenges for the other 4 incubated companies (in your opinion) beyond their ability to raise more $$?

-will CSU/NEVA continue to incubate companies in Fort Collins in parallel with Kenya  or is the focus now on the partnership with USIU?

1006878,2012-11-15,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"HI Jennifer,  

Here's my quick and dirty opinion on the other companies, not necessarily empirical fact.  

1. Vivodec - The wanted to get dengue-control curtains in houses in Guatemala and chose a convoluted business model to do that.  1. Export high quality hand weavings from Guat. 2. Incorporate those textiles into high end pillows for US homes, using unemployed seamstresses in rural colorado  3 Sell those pillows like Tom's Shoes sells his stuff (buy one give one). 4. Hang curtains in Guat.  5.  Repeat and scale.  They have not sunk this business, but the team is fractured. They are now looking at just making high end fashion pillows for home decorating.  Not the most exciting thing for us, but they're still going.  

2. Access Academies - These two Ghanaian students are passionate about building an affordable private school system in Accra, but they are financially stressed.  Esther took a very good job as Africa VP for HR for FINCA.  She's in Uganda, paying debts and saving money to eventually do her school thing.  Her partner, Afrane, is out looking for work.  Our plan is to put some money together to support people like Afrane, and we have a campaign to do so, but no cash yet.  Access may yet implement their plan, but that could be in 3 or 5 years.  

3. Clean Engines -  They are trying to raise a Series A round.  Bill Kramer raised around $750K in friends and family money, but is now really struggling to get the additional capital he needs to start manufacturing and sales.  They may yet do it, but it's a tough business. 

4. Small Engines for Economic Development - SEED is still alive, but Mitesh seems stuck on the runway, unable to get BRAC to place a large enough order to lower unit costs. Meanwhile, he's looking at BRAC as a channel through which he can sell other products to farmers in Bangladesh.  So again, this is not a dead venture, but it's stuck on the runway.

5. The two undergrad ventures that we let in basically failed to show up.  The woman doing a line of cosmetics from bees wax and honey is still doing it out of her home, while the guys with the solar array for events sold their model to someone, or so we heard.  They really never spent much time in NEVA. 

6. TANS - Dr. Jess Davis' Thin Air Nitrogen Solutions is still going.  She has a DIV grant for $110K from USAID to keep developing the technology and a team on the ground in Ethiopia.  With progress, she'll get the next tranche of over $1 million.  The college isn't keen on NEVA serving faculty, so we're kind of kicking her out.  CASE may try to find a way to keep her affiliated with our center.  

7. Creative Spring - This is still going.  Chris and his team are launching a beta, I believe, and are hopeful to continue the venture post graduation. 

8.  Grouse Malting - Twyla is moving forward with her venture but never really got much from us.  With the Institute for Entrepreneurship taking over NEVA, it won't be open to people who graduated long ago, so Twyla will have to build it somewhere else.  

9.  Cradle of Tea -  Jim Schmitt wants to build this but took a job with USAID in Afghanistan so that he could pay off his student loans.  He hopes to get back to Cradle in a year or so when he's got some money to build it.  


If you want more information, let us know.  Jes has managed a lot of this.  Charisse has now taken over.  IF you wanted to reach out to any of the entrepreneurs, we'd be happy to connect you.  

Talk tomorrow.

1006880,2010-12-14,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Interim report f/up: I asked Gwyn about his newly formed advisory group: 
Jeff Ladd did a mid career one year program at Sloane last year during which he sat in on my class.  He also joined us for most of the trip last January and in effect became a co-trip leader.  He has a business background and is interested in possibly being involved in a US non-profit to help fund Rickshaw Bank.  

Pallavi Chaube is married to a Sloane student and coincidentally was in college in Delhi with someone who has worked with Dr. Sarmah a lot.  She has a business background has lived outside India for the past few years but knows the Indian business environment well.  She has a position set up in a company near here but is not employed while they get her a work visa so she is able to help out.

Sule Amadu is Ghanian, did an MBA with Paul Hudnut at Fort Collins, and just finished an Acumen one year internship in India working for D-Light.  You may know him.  I have worked with him in Peru and Ghana and have a lot of respect for him.  

The working group has only had a few sessions since Dr. Sarmah left but it has already been a huge help to me.  As you know, the distinction between profit and non-profit has big implications.  Right now, in India and in regard to micro-finance organizations, this is more true than ever as the micro-finance is going through a political / financial crisis which was partly fueled by outcry over an IPO of SKS microfinance, the largest player in the sector.  We are looking at the histories of some large non-profits to see how they grew as well as looking at the legal implications of linked organizations in India and the US and hybrid for profit / non profit entities.

It was great to have James for a session in class thanks again!

Thanks for the recent update and for being forthright about the scaling/economic sustainability issues. I'm sure it's disappointing but given the current microcredit crisis, not all that surprising. 

So - one quick question. You say:
""For now Rickshaw Bank can look toward moderate growth based on new funds from the US and work to develop a plan for scaling to the need when the micro-credit crisis has abated."" 

What will the AFNA fundraising $$ go towards? Subsidizing the cost of ownership? If so, please explain how that works. Or is it for operational expenses?

1006880,2011-05-18,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Conversation with Gwyn 5/18/11 in response to my question. Sounds like they are in a bit of a crisis or at least a holding period:

Gwyn will be in Ghana July 7- August 5 2011 for IDDS then he will head to India to visit the Rickshaw Bank project.

 ·      Rickshaw Bank is not currently at break even.  Due to servicing debt the number of rickshaws they can build is declining; they have lots of loans consuming operating. capital.  Hasn’t been apparent to Dr. Sarma who doesn’t focus on $.  Rickshaw Bank is technically a NP subsidiary of Center for Rural Development (vet services for farmers) also founded by Dr. Sarmah


 ·      2 Volunteers (a Citibank VP in NY is also interested) recruits are working with Dr. Sarmah on untangling current financial situation and a business model for moving forward:


 Jeff Ladd – mid career MIT alum doing fundraising for Rickshaw Bank


 Neal Mehta– grew up in US, knows India, of Indian decent – Stanford MBA student


 Also adding MIT undergrad students +1 grad student (Mark Jenette from Singapore University Tech http://www.sutd.edu.sg/) to the team.


 Gwyn’s priority this summer is testing current prototypes, not building. Rickshaw bank was recently accepted into a program of social entrepreneurship at Yale. Not sure what that program’s focus is.


 Bottom line is that they are fundraising b/c they need more $ to avoid shrinking – Dr. Sarmah is a little afraid to change things. Gwyn has had some conversation about being a for-profit but Dr. Sarmah is hesitant.  Talked about different structures, like a co-op.


 Before designing a business model for the future, they need a firm foundation.

However, Dr. Sarmah is here at MIT (and coming back next month for the Tech Award in LA, very exciting). CRD is the parent of Rickshaw Bank, lots of turnover there. Yale program partner is Morgan Stanley and they are trying to put together a plan for fundraising and growth and probably transitioning to a for profit (to get away from the dark cloud of microfinance). Jeff Laad is a former student (mid career) is working on fundraising. Assam Foundation of N. America (AFNA) responded to the Tech Awards and has been supportive. If they do become for profit, rickshaw bank drivers could own shares. There is some tension between AFNA and the govt of India since the 70s for political reasons - some parts of Assam is out of control of the Indian govt. Coal region that feels ignored by Indian govt. Dr. Sarmah thinks Rickshaw Bank should distance itself from AFNA...so things like the website affilations will need to get Action: send Gwyn IER and then an extension letter through August 2012.

None of this is public; please keep it within NCIIA until the deal is done. This could end up being sold in the Western world as well. They have renamed their project Brilliance http://www.d-rev.org/projects/brilliance.html

Phil, Joseph, they are looking for about $200k in further funding (see below) and want to approach Lemelson - is the funding freeze still on? Any other ideas? JKJ

NOTES from call with Krista and Ben 8.13.10:

6885-09 Enabling Effective Management of Neonatal Jaundice in Rural India (Sustainable Vision)

Partner:
They have found an Indian (Phoenix) manufacturer who is interested in licensing the product. Phoenix has their own distribution channels in India and several other developing countries. They feel lucky b/c the founder of Phoenix is interested in profit but also socially minded and wants to make a difference in children's lives. Phoenix wants to do a launch around Nov. 2010 which they are on track to do.

Deal:
Royalties: Pheonix will pay DREV about $20k for product dev. IP is encumbered according to Stanford, so they won't exercise their rights. DREV would get $10/device sold in the industrialized world and $1 per device for devlopping world hospitals/clinics. Negotiating exclusivity. Also want to cap the price so that Phoenix can only charge max. 3X the cogs. Ben didn't want $ (also he is now technically a staff member of Drev and he has signed over IP to DREV). All $ goes back to fund other projects. 


Technology:
Two devices - one aimed at urban markets (Brilliance) and second is for rural markets, not yet ready. Urban device has 12 led's but is sleek. They had a product design intern at Stanford. Price is to keep it under $300 compared to $3k. Have done benchtop testing and it outperforms the comparable US devices.  Almost frozen design, working on the stand. Longer tern could sell in the West. The tech innovation is a combination of small things. High efficiency low cost LEDs - needs a constant current - created this and then realized that this means they could get rid of the cooling fan that is expensive and breaks easily. Also including elements required for safety and elements to allow interaction with other devices - others like Duke's photogenesis don't have this. Could use pieces of this technology for other devices. 


Regulatory path:
Clinical trials not necessary  for a device like this in India in oder to get regulatory approval. Doing it anyway b/c it will help with adoption. Won't hurt to have regulatory approvals and having that data will be useful. Want to involve a couple of member of INN plus another inst. in Northern India - head of pediatrics who has run clinical trials - he is drafting the protocal and he will invite a few other neonatolgists. Stanford will technically run the trials even though they will be done with partners in India.

Funding:
There's a lot of interest from VCs but treading carefully - priority for them is the developing world.  Launcing in India but want to scale with Phoenix in other dev. country markets (they already do this.)  Would do all the safety testing and cotract out formal validation to bodies used for regulatory approval (by the end of Nov) could start selling the device. Clinical trial would last 4-6 mo and they hope that would boost sales. Data to get published would take over a year. Will also have presence at neonatology conferences. Rural model is based on a WHO model - getting conflicting info on procing. Want to keep the price under $100, still need to do some product dev. but it's pretty far along. 

Impact:
Ben has already saved a life with a prototype he was testing. If they can hit the pricing target, they should be able to sell several thousand a year. Also doing some SROI calculations - estimate each device will treat 80 babies a year. So hundreds of thousands of lives affected in first 2-3 years is their estimate.

Next steps:
Krista is on her way to India this week, meeting with Lifespring and others. Ben will be going back to Stanford this fall and will stay involved. Seeking funding for Brilliance  clinical trials will be run by Stanford in India. Will need $ for engineering and tech support, design for maufacturability now that Ben is back in school. Also want to fund monitoring and evaluation - real people on the ground collecting data. Looking for $100-$200k. Could structure the $ to go to Stanford or DREV. Applying for $ from Gates (they think it's a long shot) and others. What about TLF?  Grant ends Dec. 2010 and they think they will hit all their proposal objectives.

Interested in convening a cluster of faculty and students working on similar devices, to compare tech, geography, business models and discuss things like the need for an education and training component (the need for eye protection for example) and related diagnostic devices. Willing to work with NCIIA to put a meeting together. Need to do this in the fall for a spring meeting. Need to determine how much $ we can spend to do this, where and when and get input on an agenda. Then invite Rice, Duke, and others.

I had the good fortune to spend 4 days with Dr. Vempala's students (Ashwin and Hrushi) from Georgia Tech at a workshop NCIIA delivered at Stanford University last week. NCIIA is a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting students and faculty around technology, innovation and entrepreneurship http://nciia.org/ The GA Tech students spent most of the workshop  prototyping a business model for their technology and renamed their venture ""Lifenet."" (They did a great job at the workshop).  We are very interested in helping the team have as much impact as possible, which means figuring out an economically sustainable way to get their technology tested, improved and then in the hands of rural people who don't have that last mile of connectivity. From our (funder) perspective, anytime we can meet our grantees partners in the field, we welcome the opportunity. As you said in your letter of support for Dr. Vempala's project:
""The TeNeT group is a coalition of faculty members at IIT Madras who work towards a few common goals in research and development. We have substantial  experience in applying technology at the grassroots level and have been one of the pioneers in the field of ICT for Development in India and believe that business models need be built around connectivity solutions, to impact the developing regions positively and sustainably. The last mile / hundreds of meters continue to be a challenge.""

If you have about an hour to spend with our director, Phil Weilerstein, while he is in Chennai, it would be very interesting to learn about some of the business models you have been involved with and also how you will be able to help the GA Tech team.

Please confirm if you have any availablity on Feb. 9. Many thanks, Jennifer

1006843,2011-05-16,Leann Leake,"Exchange between Lars Olson and Jose Gomez-Marquez 5/16/11 about FDA approval:  Hi Lars 
As I told Jennifer is that if you have money in the bag to go with FDA approval, then call NextBreath in Maryland and have them do a 510(k) for you. It should essentially be a desktop procedure. 

If not, pick a country that is more reasonable---Nicaragua, Ecuador, or Honduras---which do not insist on FDA approval. You could do a CE self certification procedure. Finally, if El Salvador insists, either have them pay for it, or go to another country....they have a lot more to lose than you do. The are lots of countries to choose from. We have variants on nebulizers in Nicaragua and have found no problem in getting them locally disseminated. El Salvador is a relatively rich country, if you talk to the right people they may be able to cough up the funds to help you. Otherwise, I would really take a second look at your reason for being there. On more thing, tell the salvadorans that you are exploring other options. In my experience, that gets pele moving

Hi Jose,

Jennifer Keller-Jackson suggested I talk with you about FDA approval.  We are moving our device toward FDA approval for two reasons:  1) it looks like it may not cost too much money, and 2) El Salvador and other governments are insisting on it.

Jennifer said that your experience was different.  FDA approval may still be a hurdle too high to climb so I'm interested in alternatives.

Thanks for any advice you can give,

We worked at Prosthetic Clinic in Phung Hiep (Funded by NCIIA and investors) for 5 days and able to manufacture and fitted 13 (2 prosthetic teams) and treated 400 orthopedic patients.  Then we went to Quang Tri (Central of Vietnam) and fitted 73 prosthetic devices and treated more than 900 orthopedic patients.  The local Vietnamese prosthetic technicians have been continuing to treat and fit amputees.  I will send pictures and more information regarding the prosthetic clinic to you.

I am writing about the budget for my NCIIA Neonatal Project. As you
know we have had a very successful outcome for our affordable
phototherapy device, Brilliance, and are very pleased to bring our
device to market through an established neonatal medical device
manufacturer and distributor in India, Phoenix Medical Systems in
Chennai. My final report will give you all the details, although I
know Krista has been also keeping you posted. In the meantime the
people in the Stanford's research administration are asking me to get
approval from NCIIA for project expenditures that have deviate from
the initial budget itemization.

The way things actually developed was somewhat different than
anticipated when the proposal was submitted and it caused me to change
the amounts actually spent in several categories. The following are
the items I would like you to approve:

1. Travel $24,704 (from $15,000)
2. Stipends $14.915 (from $16,600)
The breakdown of these stipends is as follows:
Students Stipends $3,720 (from $1,600)
Faculty Stipends   $10,115 (from $12,000)
Other Stipends      $  1,080 (from $3,000)

The reason for the increased travel changes is that, with the transfer
to Phoenix in India, I had to send some of our people to iterate the
design for local manufacturing, delivery and launch. In the proposal
we thought mainly in terms of travel for visits to medical sites for
need-finding with doctors and patients. However, once things started
to take off members of the team had to also make extra trips to ensure
speedy and efficient ramp up of production. To help mitigate this
change, I myself made only one trip -to assist with the actual product
launch at a neonatal-care conference (Federation of Asia and Oceania
Perinatal Societies meeting in Delhi).

It turned out that we were able to have much of the prototyping done
with students assistants paid on an hourly basis; this accounts for
the increased student stipend amount.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
All the best,

Bernie

Started in Ghana, then go towards Rwanda. 
Genice Jacobs, met her online (as a result of Discovery Series article). Recruiter/head hunter. Worked with a group in Uganda. Came to NY a few moths ago. Uganda Space – women’s group – raising $8k to send them out 4 systems. 
Nadia Smith trying to estab. an airline in Nigeria – lives in CT. She looks at this from a $ point of view. “How much do we need to get these in place.” Knows you have to be careful how to introduce this via state governer’s so it doesn’t get hijacked (someone taking it, building it for half the price with junk components). Now they have a microprocessor they can protect the code. Ongoing conversation about how to roll this out – 500 systems (1 system = 80 lanterns).
Jacob – introdued to him through Genice. Has acknowledged no one is doing this on a large scale yet. He is very interested to help them do it. He’ll put them in touch with the right people. Counting on him.
Wanted to finish the engineering – feel really confident now and are ready to engage. 
NCIIA’s expectation is that this should reach venture phase. Should begin to have a discussion with VWell. Would like to seriously consider investment in the future and bring support / coaching. 
Incubate within Cooper. Start up as a social business – if that’s not too complicated.
Intention is to design ourselves out of this. If the orders are huge, it might now make sense to package up the parts over here. Have them sourced from China/India – open to that in the future. Want to have as much control as we can. Could determine costing/logistics and then bring in someone to do this. Bring in a professional mgmt team, will need to validate the opportunity for them.  Put feelers out to find those people. 
Should put together a plan that might go well beyond what the startup team will do. Challenge will be to get enough funding to hire/find a mgmt team. Toby does not want to lead this but he doesn’t want to give up control too early either.
Action:
Summarize commercialization piece and summarize the roles and commitment. A plan for the plan: who, where, by when, do what. Need to follow up with Dan for coaching and Joseph re VWell cohort.

Went to El Salvador and Guatemala 8 years ago. Saw the poverty, lack of electricity and watched people drinking albuterol. Albuterol is donated. 
Have worked with design teams (senior design projects) over the last 4-5 years – have applied for a provisional patent (Marquette owns the IP). Two working prototypes. ANADES is a regional healthcare hospital, 35 remote sites and a network in place – aids/hiv and diabetes as well as. 
What is the pathway at Marquette. Debated a 51c3 or stay within Marquette. Longterm view – separate ngo is appropriate. ANADES is more comfortable with the team being at Marquette. Starting to look for board members – so it’s the next logical step. Have sensed no resistance from Marquette in widely disseminating this. Precedent for sharing of IP. 
Need to more carefully identify the markets. First impression is that there’s no money in the community. Business model will need to be investment by other entities. Chris is in El Salvador now, scheduling a meeting with Ministry of Health between now and May – trust factor with Marquette more so than another entity.
Who will handle the risk? Maybe Marquette won’t want to…
Thereapeutic device is what is planned.
To be effective, needs to be deployed locally and needs to EVALUATE whether community health care workers can use it, clean it. (don’t want to transmit disease). In the training, there is a diagnostic component. Will buy pulmonary function testers ($) in selling this to the ministry of health – to show the workers can do all this.  Necessary to convince the Ministry of Health.
Broad view: huge market for other apps:
ARE using this to get a sputem sample for TB testing in Africa.  Could also use this for lower respiratory infections and for inhaling .

Lars knows asthma, knows El Salvador – this is a low hanging fruit. 
Studies so far: sputem induction trial. Don’t have this data til May 2010. Still very early for commercialization. Human studies are beyond the grant period. Hope to work with the local university for the human studies. Need to prove this to the Ministry. Due to new elections, ANADES and others are well connected to Ministry of Health. Politics.

Background: Dartmouth students have been very interested in dev. country issues. Started with EWB but decided they could have more success with HELP (humanitarian eng. leadership project). Student run initiative. Don’t like the one shot projects, like sustainable business plans so Elsa convinced the students to follow the business path rather than a one-off.  Elsa worked for AID in DC for a year.
Two-term projects based course for eng. seniors. Often have projects connected to that course. Also some masters – engineering mgmt taught jointly with Tuck faculty. One Tuck person is identified as helping undergrads (Greg Fairbrothers) – could include him. Dartmouth Entrepreneur Network (DEN).
Tuck prof Lisa Miller is consulting on the project and one student from Tuck has been to Rwanda. 
Don’t know yet if Rwanda is where this is going to happen. Will spend some time this summer researching who the partners are. Were some problems and graft involved. 
Key technology is in locally manufacture-able turbine components. The idea was not to have any imported parts. Do this as a franchise to allow local entrepreneurs. Has worked effectively in one site – let people charge their batteries. 
Have some serious questions about partners that they have to answer- until then a business plan doesn’t make sense. Africa doesn’t run like America- have to please the chief…requires boots on the ground thinking about this carefully. Want to partner with universities and identify some students, maybe about to graduate.
Derek has been to Rwanda. When an org. comes in with $, they are going to fight over the aid $. End of making enemies wherever you implement. In Rwanda, maybe USAID, German version of AID, UNDP that have high level contacts.  Hoping to decide when and where by the end of summer 2010, by the end of 2011, have a business model.

Pali (PI) Jim (school of mgmt/eship), Survesh (eng), Ruth (nursing), Betty (nursing), Phil, JKJ 
Background: nursing faculty has been going to Nicaraugua with nursing and engineering students on a water project for years, started as a result of alums visiting Waslala. They paid for 2 priests to come up to Villanova then sent down 2 groups. They have a stable network of health promoters, good relationships with priests and health workers. Pali visited in May 09 re designing small scale hydroelectric system/water project.  Attended IEEE conf., got the idea to apply engineering to Millenium challenge issues. Work closely with the Water for Waslala program (some of these people are involved).
Reviewer issues
1) Health care workers.  Volunteer model- no shortage. Population of10k in the city, 45k rural population, poor, many remote. Health promoters organized through each parish, male or female, educated by the local doctors/nurses. One paid person, Tim Hansel, head of volunteers. No equipment whatsoever. Learn basics of baby care, sanitation. Workers are largely illiterate. Tim is very excited about this project. 
2&3) BUS MODEL AND SCALE
Initial startup: they/funders would provide initial capital. 
First trip down there would be to develop the business model. Will want to validate this in the field. THEY HAVE NO REAL IDEA YET WHAT WILL WORK. Incentives – work out a system where health worker can call for prescription, small fee for worker call/pick up centralized system. Revenue models – medicine delivery fees? (PHIL: Need to be explicit about which models to test. Want more than just writing a report. Dominant cell phone company CLARO – could they partner with them? 
4)	Impact: will measure the number of contacts at the hospital and health outcomes. Specifically, infant and maternal mortality. Just being able to identify problems with the pregnancy before delivery could help or what to do with hemorrhaging…hypertension. Will count cell phone contacts/# of calls then health outcomes. Health promoters would be trained to do the follow up piece.
First trip / assessment for this project will be in May 2010. (Betty will go in March on the water project).
Other: seem happy/relieved/interested in AI2V Stanford.

Looking for $24M, but they hope they can function without that $.
Bill is developing CASE programming:
Major focus is on Exec Ed: reaching out to 3 markets. Focused on leadership, sustainability, tools. Line business manager tasked with delivering on sustainability objectives. Also, those seeking career advancements around sustainability. (Ken Petersen is also integral with his supply chain background, and another HP Global Supply guy Greg Herman to build communities of practice.)
Communities of Practice – will be defined by common meta challenges, crossover sectors or could turn out to be companies within beverage, agriculture. 
Annual costs of SVA will be close to $200k; want to provide entrepreneurs with $1k per mo per entrepreneur – that’s the biggest cost. A little bit more concrete (table p. 5). 
2. Geography issue – global focus far away from Ft. Collins. Is it the plan to attract ventures in the incubator that has specific connection to technical expertise in the university community in Ft. Collins. 
Panda Bikes came out of GSEE now in another incubator in town…have had some domestic projects coming in, but mostly intl. SVA will not just be for GSSE students – will open it up to other students on campus. Mitesh SEED will look for a spot. 
Carl has a strong bias re technologies that come out of CSU. Will likely select ventures from GSSE where there is a strong link to CSU technology. Eg, Zubaida will be traveling back and forth and co-located in other incubator overseas. She is registered as a for profit in US and India – the extension of being part of CSU helps with credibilty and strength of networks. Carl is working with dev. other institutions around the world and also to use distance learning for GSSE in 25 countries in Africa (vision is to have 25 Zubaida’s in Accra at partner universities). See SVA as being a relatively short-term situation. Graduating students would move to incubator then graduate to Ft. Collins incubator or moving their operations overseas. 
Carl is interested in coming to the workshop or conf. – NCIIA conf. might be a better fit. Zubaida and team member to attend Stanford as part of other SV grant.
Year by Year milestones of funds raised for SVA. Would also be interested to see the bplan for CASE and the Exec Ed program.

Gwyn and Amy, Phil and jkj
All the projects are rickshaw projects; most of the students from the class will come. Worked on 3 areas that the bank wanted to work on; course is divided into 2 parts. First part all are working on the same thing, then 
will build prototypes and leave them there for testing. They leave 1/5/2010.
First visit of a d-lab team. Need to understand the problems communities face and bring back the challenges for classes to work on. This can feed into other d-lab classes too – will be looking for additional projects for the program as a whole. 
Rickshaw Bank (microfinance located in Assam, near Bangladesh) makes it possible for drivers to own their own machine. Want their rickshaw to be more attractive. They launched in 2004 and had a local univ. design an improved rickshaw and it was partially successful. Cheaper to buy less steel and drivers like it better if it’s lighter. Motivation – attract customers – they give their drivers shirt and shorts, rickshaw looks spiffier. Two levels of customers, drivers and riders. ITDP http://www.itdp.org/ is another rickshaw project – had trouble getting interest. 90% of rickshaws are owned by owners, rented to drivers. They are at the mercy of the owners of the equipment. They want them to be cheap, not interested in long term. Not a lot of interest in a better rickshaw. Who is the market – both drivers and owners.
Cost is the same to own vs. rent…if they drive full time. Some are seasonal/go back to the farm for harvest – owning may not make sense. 
Phil asked re scalability:  Rickshaw Bank is getting a lot of support from the govt. Want to expand Rickshaw Bank to 80 cities. May not set up a factory in all those cities, just a microfinance org. Will try to get a grasp of what they are doing in what cities. Model of moving ownership to drivers. Would be a positive case study.  Need to understand whether the new design will be disseminated (by Rickshaw Bank – they are open source on everything they say) to other cities. Want to know how that turns out.  Will the new design be adopted – use the bank’s leverage to get this design used.  Want them to set some objectives and report back to see what they can do re an open source wave of innovation in a certain geographic area. 
Can microfinance be the catalyst for improved tech advantage? (Lots of improved designs don’t scale, can MFI’s help?). 
Wheelchairs: related.
Dr. Sarma is interested in setting up a kiosk program for stamps and kiosks for disabled people. Wheelchair shops that Amos Winter works with, don’t have a model that works.
Business expertise: 
have talked to Sloan and hope to give them more info. upon return of the trip. Taking Jeff Lead who audited the class who is going on the trip. Gwyn has a background in business and operations. 
Is the work transferable in part to another location?
Hoping to identify a model Amos Winter can start using in Africa. Opportunities in Bangladesh and Pakistan – also as they get pressured for non polluting solutions. Large field of opportunity.
Want to structure the grant with these deliverables:
-what is the transferable innovation
-scalable business opportunity?
-learnings – captured as a case study.",Internal Note,Completed,Normal,00570000004VlXPAA0,Post Award Note--2010/01/21 Stefanie Costa

We’ll want to see a more holistic work plan through achievement of economic sustainability (post grant period). Bigger picture – timelines showing when each party gets involved to do what. And what’s within the scope of the grant.

Santosh, Ashwin (student), Phil, JKJ
Background one hop to a wireless network is easy, but multiple hops seems to be harder – needs an algorthym. Wrote a paper with this simulated algorthm.
Connected with IIT Chennai – Ashok – trying to provide connectivity to rural India. Specific challenge connect 50-100 users in 1 mile radius and one broadband access point – became very concrete.
Didn’t want to build hardware that no one can afford. Decided to build a linux module for standard internet protocol that allows them to do their own routing. Hard to find students to do this programming.  Found Ashwin (sp?) who could do this work, masters student – his thesis is on this, up to 15 nodes. Technology now seems to have promise. Now how to take this and make it real.  Another student has joined who has worked at IIT Chennai, he’s at GA Tech as a Master’s student – he’s been involved with Ashok and a spinoff company who tries to provide affordable Internet access. 
Partners – now 3 developed this fall. 
TNET Group – academic group on IIT Madras campus. Also serve as a business incubator. Will do a full scale evaluation in city block and village. Have a history of spinouts, could help incubate a company once there’s proof that it works. 
Federal Aviation Authority – office in GA. Performed a full scale drill / test. Their interest is being able to respond in disasters. FAA has consulting companies that would like to work on this too.
In Namibia – with the CDC office there. They have a big dish there, can’t connect any other way. What if they let them use their connectivity to provide Internet access to the surrounding area. Put them in touch with some nonprofits. 
Entrepreneurial pathway: 2 scenarios
-goal is to try to connect people. goal is not to make a big profit. They want to keep the core technology open source/free. Thinking about a service for dev. world – could patent that and form a company around dev. that service. Re disaster mgmt, would patent that service and make a company. 
Who’s involved on the business side: both FAA and TNET group. Encouraged them to find a student perhaps out of the TIGRE program and connect them to Gray Ghost. 
Concerned about controlling where and how this will be used (don’t want  this for military purposes). Phil said grab the commercialization

Willing to buy the socket and prosthetic. First trip to Vietnam fit 35 prosthetics for $35 each; brought 7k in prosthetics donated by Hanger Inc. Humidity is an issue in Vietnam and their socket has ventilation. Don’t have a design for ankle, knee, foot, but looking to do these designs themselves – need more funding for that. Set up a manufacturer in Vietnam. Paying for 3 people to come from Vietnam: Pres. from an orthopedic company, a doctor and a technician. Getting visas, probably mid 2010.
Will share the IP – 50/50 with Vietnamese venture. Will be able to manufacture socket in Vietnam for a lot less than $35 and sell. 50/50 split between Mercer and Vietnamese company and will send some faculty and students to work there on the technical. Hope to expand to Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam.

John Duffy, Phil, JKJ
The background: Director of theNatl Center for Community Engagement in AZ, works with John’s wife and has gone with them to Peru (she’s Mexican).She has worked with tribal college in service learning and she said hey it’s just like Peru here. Climate and poverty is the same, John traveled out there. Natural fit with John’s work. Students in capstone courses have redesigned solar panels, composting toilets, evaporative cooler, solar cooker, solar hot water systems. Designs were targeted as part of products that could be competitive with things on the market – capstone exercise. Students started building things; Dir. got grants to help build prototypes. 
1)	Tribal microenterprise support/funding. George Neil (tribe) try to fund microenterprise for their own people. Feasible to develop a microenterprise project within this grant? Idea is to have these built locally and benefit from this work. Tech transfer to tribal nation. 
2)	Acceptance of new technologies: some of the students are talking about homesteading and John would donate some modules. American Indians like that these technologies are like “going back” to traditional tools and technologies.
John is hesitant to embrace eship; he sees himself as purely technical. We won’t turn him into an entrepreneur but maybe his students. Get him to attend kickoff workshop with someone from the tribal microfinance org. 
Phil: Address the next steps of the project. Have an objective to develop and test a model of economic sustainability. Have people on the project who are primarily focused on the business dimension. Concerned about replication. Connect John with Dan O’Neil. 
John will contact the tribal folks re workshops.
