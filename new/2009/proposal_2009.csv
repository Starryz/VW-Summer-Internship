Nebulizers allow for the highest impact on respiratory problems while minimizing systemic effects of particular drugs.  Compressor-style nebulizers force air at a constant rate through a submersed orifice contained in the mouthpiece.  The mouthpiece is inexpensive, but the compressor is costly and uses electricity.  The human-powered nebulizer (HPN) replaces the electric compressor with a leg-powered source of air flow.  This way, the HPN can be used in places in the developing world where electricity is unavailable.  The HPN has been shown to be equivalent to a commercial nebulizer.  The HPN can be used in treatment of asthma and COPD.  It can be used to improve TB diagnosis and vaccination delivery. In the long-term, the HPN can be studied for its effectiveness in treatment of lower respiratory infections, the number three killer in the world.  Integral to this new technology is deployment to remote areas and training of community members to deliver treatment using the HPN (for treatment of acute asthma attacks, for example).

Neonatal jaundice can cause kernicterus (permanent brain damage), with manifestations including deafness, cerebral palsy, and death. In the United States the advent of phototherapy treatment, which involves shining light on the baby, has played a key role in the virtual elimination of kernicterus.  In India however, only a small sub-set of the population (typically wealthier urbanites) has access to effective devices for diagnosis and treatment; consequently, neonatal jaundice is still a major threat to health of newborn babies.   In August 2009, our team interviewed doctors and nurses at 24 hospitals and clinics in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Karnataka.

Incomes are raised through substantial reductions in fuel costs, deforestation is reduced by replacing firewood with a sugarcane by-product, and social capital is built. Currently, more than 100 evaporators are used in Honduras.  Producers who have adopted report reductions in firewood use from 66% to 80% while substantially cutting production time.  The majority of producers trained in this project will be from the high poverty departments of Lempira and Intibuca, though producers from other regions will also participate to broaden dissemination. Technical assistance will guide oven construction and evaporator management. Baseline data will be collected before and after the project to assess impacts, challenges and benefits. The project is highly replicable with potential for expansion throughout Honduras and Latin America.     The major objectives are to:   1) Train 100 low-income farmers in the use of the new evaporator to raise incomes and reduce deforestation   2) Train 5 new metal fabricators in production of the evaporator   3) Utilize microfinance to fund a minimum of 10 new evaporators and ensure a sustainable supply of future capital   ",1006927,Invited Resubmit,6927-09,0013900001aYWZXAA4,a2C39000002zYtDEAU,01239000000Ap02AAC,The Lemelson Foundation

Smart Grid to deliver power to people living in poverty,50000,Smart Grid to deliver power to people living in poverty,California State Polytechnic University-Pomona, ,2009-10-16,2009-10-19, , ,"Abstract      Nearly over 1.5 billion people live in poverty and some cannot afford to pay for their electric bill so that they can keep warm in winter and cold in the summer time.   The main idea is to design and develop a low cost system to calculate the amount of extra power not used or power wasted in a transmission and distribution line, store it somewhere and then deliver it to people living in poverty, just as the same way we deliver food to people that needed most.  This idea can lead to creation and commercialization of a new system that will help the power companies to explore lost and excess power and then store it in a storage area that is large enough and then deliver to the proper places that have a need for it but cannot afford it.       Working in conjunction with local companies such as, Southern California Edison (SCE) and engineers, entrepreneurs, the team plans to install a pilot system at a local area that serves more people that cannot afford the electric bill.  In a later time an arrangement will be made for technology transfer, training and completion of a business plan for installation of such a system. The ideas in application design will use the current industry standards.  There are currently two graduate students and one faculty assigned to this project.

Data from UNICEF shows that only 82% of the people living in rural areas of the country have access to such resources.  Since many people living in these areas have limited income, this portion of the population do not have the means to purify water, or have access to purified drinking water, thus increasing the occurrence of adverse health effects from contaminated drinking water.       We propose addressing this issue by using a two-pronged approach centered on our personal water filtration technology, which uses natural products indigenous to the Philippines.  In the first case, our non-profit company will distribute and maintain the filtration technology for the region of Nagcarlan, Philippines   a disadvantaged area with a contaminated water supply.  In the second case, the company intends to market and commercialize this filtration technology in the United States to help fund the endeavor in the Philippines, and potentially other impoverished areas of the world.

Low Cost Cement Replacement Using Corn Ash for Masonry Mortar in Sub-Saharan Africa,48069,Low Cost Cement Replacement Using Corn Ash for Masonry Mortar in Sub-Saharan Africa,University of Missouri-Kansas City, ,2009-10-02,2009-10-16, , ,"Cement is expensive and developing countries struggle obtaining cement to produce mortar for basic masonry structures. Some recent investigations into low-cost cement replacement for developing countries have included wood saw dust ash, locally available clays, and limestone fines from crushing operations. These materials serve to stretch the cement supply, but sacrifice long-term strength and durability. Preliminary research has shown that ash produced from burning corn residue (stalks, husks, and cobs) has the potential to beneficially supplement available cementitious materials. Corn ash can be a source of food, source of energy, and become a durable building material. Investigating corn ash as a cost-effective solution may help to improve the standard of living of corn growing developing countries, such as Sub-Saharan Africa.   Using chemical, microscopic, and thermal analysis techniques, corn husk ash has been shown as a viable replacement for some cement in masonry mortar when produced in laboratory conditions. The objectives of this research are to transition corn ash production from laboratory techniques to the field by investigating rudimentary kiln for quality ash production to supplement masonry mortar. Upon completion of the controlled field tests additional field testing and technology transfer will be performed in conjunction with the Building and Road Research Institute of Ghana.

It provides an opportunity for student involvement in meeting the developing world s energy needs.  International energy development efforts have largely followed two divergent models:  large, national-scale energy projects (approaching the billion dollar level) or micro-scale investment aimed at assisting individuals or households.  An alternative approach is to develop projects at a community level.  This approach utilizes local energy sources to address the basic energy needs of a community.  Focusing on energy within a 'nucleus' optimizes development by providing for the immediate needs of a community, while fostering local technical entrepreneurship. It provides access to energy so critical to development, while promoting sustainable growth.
