International Rammed Earth Housing Project,49475,International Rammed Earth Housing Project,University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, ,2010-08-31,2010-10-15, , ,"Earthen materials in general and rammed earth in particular have been used for construction since time immemorial. Some earthen structures built centuries ago are still performing satisfactorily today. Rammed earth construction entails the compaction of soil consisting of a mixture of clay and loose grains to create structural elements, most commonly walls. Rammed earth construction is appealing for many reasons, including the use of building materials resident at the building site (the soil) and the significant insulating properties of the earthen walls. The primary impediment to large scale adoption of this construction technique is the cost of labor, as construction of rammed earth structures is labor intensive. It is ideal, however, as a construction option in many parts of the world where traditional construction materials are scarce and shelter is desperately needed. Proposed herein is the design, construction, and testing of a self-contained rammed earth construction kit that can be easily transported anywhere in the world and used in the construction of numerous structures in developing areas using as the primary building material the local soil. A senior design team from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs will take on this design effort as partial fulfillment of the requirements of their senior design program. Upon completion of this initial design effort, a full-scale prototype will be constructed and tested, and a pilot construction project in partnership with Habitat for Humanity International will be initiated.",1007813,Not Accepted,7813-10,0017000001LSVo8AAH,a2C39000002zYt9EAE,01239000000Ap02AAC,The Lemelson Foundation

The resulting disease causes 2 million deaths and costs $84 billion in worker productivity annually. In slums, where over 1 billion live, high population densities combined with a lack of infrastructure and resources make the problem particularly acute: 80% lack basic sanitation.       Solving the global sanitation crisis requires more than simply building toilets. Our team from MIT is taking an innovative systems-based approach to pioneer a model for low-cost off-grid infrastructure that provides safe, clean and affordable sanitation to the 10 million slum dwellers in Kenya.       Through MIT Media Lab and D-Lab, we are developing a low-cost (<$200) prefabricated ferrocement toilet (versus $25,000 solutions at present) and a bicycle-powered exhaustion pump for pit latrines. This technology is combined with a holistic deployment strategy: a dense micro-franchised network of sanitation centers, a low-cost waste collection infrastructure, and a centralized processing facility that converts waste into biogas, electricity, and fertilizer that is sold commercially. This novel business model creates a sanitation cycle that is environmentally, socially, and financially sustainable.      With Carolina for Kibera, our community partner in Kenya, we spent the summer deploying two small pilots.

Based on personal reconnaissance in Haiti, the PIs have identified the need for a completely new housing paradigm for Haiti resulting from unique requirements and constraints, but with the capacity to withstand the dual threat of hurricanes and earthquakes. This proposal presents this paradigm, which is part of a comprehensive redevelopment plan for Léogâne, Haiti, but with specific focus on a new sustainable partitioning system for housing called Vèt Miray (Green Wall). Using mechanically processed agricultural waste products, Vèt Miray has the potential to not only significantly alleviate the risk posed by the cement masonry units used widely before the quake, but also addresses other Haitian societal issues related to waste disposal and economic opportunity by providing a new green industry to the region most affected by the earthquake.

For example, < 5 kg/ha fertilizer nutrients (N, P, and K) are applied to food crops in Africa on average, the lowest fertilizer use rates in the world; this has led to declining yields and incomes. This project explores the use of locally-grown cyanobacterial bio-fertilizer to empower people and improve soil fertility, crop yields, and living standards in the developing world. Producing bio-fertilizer locally could be inexpensive, and does not require extensive infrastructure, circumventing two key constraints to improving soil fertility in rural areas of the developing world. The main objectives of this project are to: 1) evaluate the key design constraints to outdoor production (raceway construction, aeration, harvesting) of cyanobacterial bio-fertilizer; 2) measure the plant-availability and yield impact of bio-fertilizer nitrogen; and, 3) calculate costs, benefits, and economic feasibility of bio-fertilizer production in Ethiopia. The project will utilize an existing collaboration with Prof. Endalkachew Wolde-meskel at Hawassa University in Ethiopia, who will advise Ethiopian graduate students funded through this proposal. Collaborators in the United States will contribute scientific and business expertise. This research will demonstrate the feasibility of bio-fertilizer production in Ethiopia, and pave the way for large-scale implementation by local entrepreneurs.

In addition, the country is entirely dependent on unsustainable fuel sources including firewood for cooking and imported fossil fuel products. To address these issues, TechnoServe, an NGO in Guatemala began the Biodiesel for Rural Development project in 2006 to demonstrate the viability of a biodiesel value chain based on Jatropha curcas to reduce rural poverty and dependency on unsustainable fuel sources. The production of biodiesel from Jatropha generates seedstock waste which is currently not being exploited. To provide continuity to this work, the Mortenson Center in Engineering for Developing Communities proposes a partnership with TechnoServe to design and disseminate appropriate technologies to create commercially viable products from the existing Jatropha seedstock waste.

Our summer 2010 collaboration between KNUST (Kumasi Ghana) and RPI (Troy, NY) explored pyrolytic biomass conversion as a way to eliminate problems associated with agricultural waste (smog, wildfires, disposal problems) and achieve energy generation. Our initial exploration found that biomass feedstock choice could be a critical factor in the social impact: some of the highest yield feedstocks (eg residue from palm oil production) were owned by some of the wealthiest farmers, suggesting that there would be little poverty relief. However we succeeded in finding a feedstock with both high potential energy yield and high social impact: corn cobs. The biochar left over after the pyrolysis can be used in soil enhancement.

The first year will focus on gait assist devices for children. As their Senior Capstone Design Project, teams of engineering and business students at Michigan Technological University (MTU) will design and build a low-cost assistive device that meets the needs of Indian culture. The students will travel to India to deliver the devices and develop ideas for the next year of MTU students.       The device must be low-cost and simple enough to build such that local Indian workers can build the device at a lower cost than what they are currently doing with the proceeds ultimately assisting the engineering and business students from Michigan Tech either directly or indirectly by hospitality during the annual trip or via direct funding. The overall goals of the program are to 1) Provide MTU students with a global design challenge and international experience, 2) Create a non-profit organization whereby merging the technical knowledge of MTU engineering and business students with the poverty/handicapped Indian workforce to build devices that will benefit those in poverty.

Agriculture is the most important sector of Ethiopia s economy, but while Ethiopia has given agriculture top priority it remains one of the ten most impoverished nations, with much of the population food insecure. Injera, a spongy sourdough flat bread made from t ef  is the staple of every Ethiopian meal and cooked over an open fire, which has resulted in severe deforestation and poor respiratory health. This project addresses environmental sustainability and the health of women and children by eliminating the need to use wood for fuel to cook injera. Injera production will be commercialized using sustainable energy sources. The cost of injera will be reduced while the nutritional quality will be improved through product formulation and scaled production. A 2010 IFPRI report calls for meeting the first Millennium Development Goal  Through Business as Unusual,  a model that calls for greater involvement of the private sector for sustainable development. The key partners are Penn State University, Addis Ababa University, African Climate Exchange and Organization for Rehabilitation and Development in Amhara.

India is a nation of contradiction.  The nation is developing, yet the cities are buzzing with IT initiatives, and India is in the news for its exponential development in the IT industry. The technological revolution taking place in India's cities has largely bypassed rural areas.  Huge economic disparity between cities and villages is widening, which is leading to desperation in rural areas. The rural economy, if focused, has the potential to turn itself into a sustainable model and help India become a real developed nation.        Program Objectives        This program provides poor rural people in a southern Indian village intensive training in making disposable areca nut plates and cups from areca nut sheaths, which would otherwise go wasted. Additionally, the program will train them in basic marketing skills.         The program leads to the creation of an economically sustainable social venture for profit with a business model that includes manufacturing, marketing, and distribution. This program, which can easily be replicated, addresses poverty in rural Indian villages. It creates entrepreneurial opportunities and defines an economically sustainable business model, created using local collaboration.          The manufactured product is completely eco-friendly, biodegradable, and hygienic.  We hope its adoption will be widespread across communities, regions, and nations.

Severe fractures occur daily throughout those countries as a result of road traffic accidents, violence, and natural disasters. These fractures require surgery for proper healing, but many victims are too poor to afford surgical implants and local surgeons have little resources to treat complex fractures. In this regard, SIGN (Surgical Implant Generation Network- founded by Lewis Zirkle, MD) has been developing and donating intramedullary (IM) nails, and training surgeons in the developing nations so they can provide immediate surgical treatment to their patients to be soon able to walk and return to work to feed and care for their families. In addition to use IM nails for surgical intervention and structural support while the bone fractures heal, low-level electrical currents have long been known to accelerate the healing of bone fractures. To provide electrical stimulation there are commercially available devices for direct attachment to the bone but require external excitation and invasive procedures for use and removal.    This project proposes a piezoelectric device that could be placed inside the IM nail and use internal excitation of physiological loading. It requires only one surgery, that of implanting the IM nail itself.   Specific aims are to:     Develop a self-powered electric stimulating device that provides electric current up to 20 µA.     Validate the performance characteristics of the design in terms of voltage and current level required for bone cell proliferation.

In Africa, approximately 33% of the population suffers from malnutrition. The ability to effectively irrigate land is associated with higher farming yields and longer growing seasons leading to a reduction of hunger and poverty.   A world away, there are approximately 80 million US single family homes, many of which have sump pumps installed in their basements to remove water from the foundations.  These pumps have a high output capacity and an average life expectancy of five and fifteen years.   The most common source of failure is not with the actual pump but with the float switch or impeller.  We estimate that several hundred thousand sump pumps are sent to landfills annually.  Alternatively, these pumps can be refurbished and integrated into a solar powered 12 V battery irrigation system for use in developing countries.

Amaranth is drought and disease resistant, and has high nutrient and immunity properties. During fieldwork, our interdisciplinary group of student-faculty teams worked with farming collectives already introduced to the grain. The number of farms producing amaranth has grown from ten to over sixty during the past three years. However, many farmers struggle with development of farming techniques and an agribusiness approach. Through participatory meetings with collectives, we identified challenges to the adoption of amaranth:  Planting and harvesting is labor intensive, and irrigation is necessary during germination. Marketing of amaranth requires collective effort (for pricing and milling), increasing demand/awareness, and branding of product. To reduce poverty within these communities, our goal is to promote entrepreneurial development and sustainable agribusinesses based on principles of microeconomics. Our collaborative work with farming groups includes three objectives:        Co-develop methods and technology for improving production of amaranth including the design and piloting of an innovative mechanical seed planter, a human-powered thresher, and water harvesting techniques.

SPEED recognizes that the future of small towns is in the hands of today s youth. A town s longevity and vitality, and the survival of its culture and values, are determined by its ability to educate a new generation of young leaders who believe in their community s future and who are willing to shape it with innovative ideas and entrepreneurial spirit. SPEED is centered on the belief that providing young people with an outstanding education in that allows them to reach their highest potential is important for individuals and their community alike. The specific goals of the project are : developing an entrepreneurial mindset in high school students, developing basic entrepreneurial skills, encouraging students to think innovatively, allowing students to actively participate in their community through community initiative development and business planning,  providing students with an entrepreneurial experience that will set them apart in the college application process, encouraging students to consider the career path of entrepreneurship, building networks and partnerships among the  New Talent  and the existing businesses/industry, providing local solutions to local problems, with eye on the future, and corporate and community partner participation and sponsorship of projects.",1008071,Not Accepted,8071-10,0017000001LSWAZAA5,a2C39000002zYt9EAE,01239000000Ap02AAC,The Lemelson Foundation
Pipeline Inspection Gauge for Pressurized Water Reactors,10000,Pipeline Inspection Gauge for Pressurized Water Reactors,University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, ,2010-10-15,2010-10-15, , ,"Our group is prototyping a novel design for a pipeline inspection gauge (PIG) for pressurized water reactors in steam turbine power plants.  The PIG will be able to operate in situ in a pipe diameter of 0.75 inches, temperatures reaching 600C, and pressures from 17 MPa to 30 MPa.  The intended prototype will offer an autonomous and timely solution for maintaining the aging pipe infrastructure that is responsible for 80% of world s power.  By developing this technology, power plants will no longer have to shut down for yearly pipeline disassembly and inspection.

Vivodec,50000,Vivodec,Colorado State University, ,2010-10-15,2010-10-18, , ,"Vivodec intends to provide increased income opportunities to poverty stricken weavers of Guatemala, while increasing the likelihood of protecting vulnerable families from suffering the economic and health effects of contracting dengue, a neglected tropical disease transmitted through mosquitos.  Vivodec will become a home accents manufacturer, beginning with decorative pillows that incorporate hand woven textiles into its designs, with social cause marketing built around a one-for-one business model.  For every decorative pillow sold, Vivodec will provide a long-lasting insecticide treated curtain to hang in a Guatemalan home in collaboration with Rotary International.  Vivodec s top three objectives are to:   1. Decrease the incidence of dengue in impoverished communities.   2. Provide increased income opportunities to Mayan weavers.     3. Expand awareness about the causes and effects of dengue, such as debility, missed educational opportunities, and decreased income.    Annually, there are 100 million cases of dengue in developing countries with tropical climates. Vivodec concentrated efforts in Guatemala because cases tripled from 2008-2009 despite Rotary efforts in a four-year dengue prevention campaign.  Over 50% of these cases have been Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), the deadlies of the four types of dengue.  Lastly, the current year witnessed a shocking increase in malaria.  Scientific evidence supports that one way to lower mosquito transmitted diseases is through the use of insecticide treated materials in bednets or more recently, curtains.  Lowering dengue in Guatemala is priority, but Vivodec hopes to add value and expand its impact by selling products incorporating heirloom quality masterpieces created by this country s talented weavers.

Electricity and Human Development,47920,Electricity and Human Development,University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, ,2010-10-15,2010-10-18, , ,"Since 2007, Empower Design has been working alongside Ugandan universities, technical institutes, and associations to co-design and implement sustainable electricity generating devices from local parts with local professionals. In countries such as Uganda, the availability of electricity is scarce. When electricity is attainable it is unreliable and overpriced. Given the tough economic situations in Uganda, the electricity crises are essential to alleviate. As a result, Empower Design strives to empower self-sufficient electricity generating devices. The goal is not to give these devices to people designed by outsiders, but rather empower them to co-design specific solutions for human development. Bicycle generators, steam generators, water wheels, wind turbines, merry-go-round generators, and hand cranked surgical lamps are all being co-designed within a reciprocal collaboration. Solar panels have only 5-10 percent efficiency compared to 10-40 percent efficiency Empower Design's devices have achieved. These devices are very cost effective and being marketed by business professors and entrepreneur collaborators. In this seventh month sustainable vision project, we will complete three steps. First, we will model the co-design devices in the US while our colleagues in Uganda test the devices for publication in top tier engineering design journals. Second, we will document the market analysis for hospitals, schools, businesses, and domestic users  capital and operational costs of our devices as well as incorporate customer feedback into our new prototypes. Third, we will begin to take this program to the north of Uganda in Gulu. With these three steps, we will harness the potential of building microgrids.",1008079,Not Accepted,8079-10,0017000001LSVpTAAX,a2C39000002zYt9EAE,01239000000Ap02AAC,The Lemelson Foundation
Sustainable Lightweight Structural Building Materials,25000,Sustainable Lightweight Structural Building Materials,New York University, ,2010-10-15,2010-10-16, , ,"This project focuses on the development of advanced light weight/cellular cement based composites for use as permanent, low-cost, and green housing materials. The proposed material derives sustainability from its high thermal insulation properties, and its requirements for less material for construction. The cellular concrete is engineered with a large network of air cell structure, while the composite action is obtained by addition of fine sand or other natural fibers, both serving as  toughening  mechanisms. We have shown that the materials perform superbly for building in earthquake prone areas and can be customized for locally available supplied materials. The scope of work includes the evaluation of the various toughening mechanism, and tailoring recipes according to what is geographically available. A worldwide GIS of the availability of materials will also be developed to address how this technology can be applied in areas of the developing world.",1008081,Not Accepted,8081-10,0017000001LSW0JAAX,a2C39000002zYt9EAE,01239000000Ap02AAC,The Lemelson Foundation
