1007919,2011-03-08,Emily Hodos,"Feedback Call Notes: on the call: students David & Ani and PI Sandy
David and Ani took the DLAB Dev class, cotaught by Sandy and Joost. They chose sanitation as their project, based on past experiences in the dev. world.
They went to Nairobi Jan 2010 for an initial assessment trip. Started entering competitions, built out team to 6 students – ME, Ind. Design, Architecture, civil engineer. 2 students spent the summer in Nairobi building out 2 prototypes in 2 slums – kibera and Lunga Lunga. Constructed slab toilets $. Worked with Carolina with Kibera (who get $ from Gates). Partner went to the community to get permission, acceptance to do this work and secured the land, got approval from village chief and organized youth group –  partner did the community relations work. Partner’s mission is to build economic opportunities for youth. In Lunga Lunga, also have a partner that secured the land, got permits, approval from village chief.
Is land acquisition a problem as they grow? Using land that is not being used within the slum. Local ownership of the toilets is the key to getting buy in. Revenues are kept locally. Ultimately, don’t see getting land as a problem. Youth unemployment is the issue – so easy to get people’s attention. Getting lots of requests saying come build here. Don’t want to expand before they’ve figured out the model.
Educational impact: have 22 teams that are operating on the ground coming out of the DLAB DEV course. Bring the successful teams back to the class so they can see what this feels like year 1, year 3, this is what didn’t work. Helps students to visualize actually doing this work. Have about 90 students sign up, about 60 stick with the class each year. Involves lots of other people in DLAB outside of the course, which helps other students.  There’s another ring of classes that are project oriented that sometimes get involved. Typically about 1/3 of the course are students from other Boston colleges. DLAB water sanitation & hygiene will be the focus of DLAB Dissemination class this spring and this project will be highlighted. Also working with EWB at MIT re shower modules.  So the impact is beyond the 6 students working on the project.
Financing: MFIs liked the $200 range, they were comfortable with that – talked to 2. They want to see revenue model and a year’s worth of operating history and data. Loan term is 12-18mo. Individual entrepreneurs would take out the loans. Carolina for Kibera has been working with youth groups for 10 years, and they know the individuals who they could work with/identify. One of the team’s mentors is VisionSpring founder – who has developed entrepreneurs with kits, uniforms, training, methodology – thinking about that model, like a franchise. Also important to add dignity to a profession with stigma. 
This will be a full time commitment besides class, ongoing sustainability is the goal. They have a business plan, which they will update and share, as well as a specific work plan for the length of the grant period. I also asked them to update the list of team members and clarify their roles. I (gently) reminded Sandy of his overall responsibility as PI etc. Students seem like go getters.
Action: follow up with reviewer feedback from and 12/31 deadline they agreed to.

Bernard and Daniel were working full time at Global Cycle Solutions with Jodi Wu, now they will work at GCS half time at this new Center half time. Bernard will focus on the technology and Daniel will work on business model. Connected to Jodi and GCS, will partner with them. Also partnering with the Small Entrepreneurs for Intl Dev through the MIT Sloan Bschool (Amy and Sloan students are co leading a trip for DLAB with Sloan students in Cambodia) and maybe the D-Lab Development Ventures class.
Student participation: the Center would be a venue for MIT students to come to the field and work with local artisans in TZ and help those artisans with issues they don’t have the tools to answer. Would be integrated into 2-3 D-Lab classes. Expect vocational students in TZ to be part of the center, also associated with an orphanage. Not a formal university. 
Their vision of success by June 2012? Have the Center up and running. Would like a dozen or so technologies dev. and built, maybe half disseminated on a small scale with an individual entrepreneur. Maybe a quarter of them are larger scale businesses. Looking at membership model for econ. sustainability. Clear sense of # visited, trained, technologies, businesses incubated.  Amy: LOTS of people making cool stuff. Focus of the technologies is local markets? But Arusha is a tourist town so there is foreign $ coming in, so entrepreneurs might target these as customers for their innovations. Markets would be local. 
Primary outcome – creating technologies. Think that making stuff has to connect with income generation. Will be a combination of people making their own stuff, some who will want to sell what they make. Want to see support not just for technical training but for business incubation. 
Daniel’s been working with Jodie since January. Daniel has worked with Bernard. Business and Center development will happen in parallel. Getting the physical space will be first, membership will evolve over time. Emphasis will shift from the space to building the membership and services. 
Phil: Less clear how much the business incubation is expected during the grant period. Set some specific milestones around this activity so that it’s part of the work plan. Want to see deliverables that lead to the launch of ventures. Detailed work plan. 
Different types of training – technical (sector specific), 2 levels of business training – think entrepreneurial and explore business models. Basic business, manufacturing, design, then focus on more specific (sector and technology) and find mentors. They would hire a local entrepreneur to do the business training who understands the TZ market. 
Overall: not an easy call, Kofi defensive and we seem to be pushing them in a direction they don’t want to go. IF they don’t have the same priorities re bus. development that we want them to have. Can we accept that?

Action: ask them to send us a more detailed work plan around the business model development, ie when will they identify and hire someone to provide the business training, what role with MIT Sloan play, what are their goals re # of ventures they want to start during the grant period etc.

Clyde D wanted to be on the call but couldn’t. 
Mariana came back from Chile this week, working with Un Techo. Produced a Safe Agua book, articulates the process and the outcome. Funding was from the govt of Chile. Part of a CA/Chile treaty, showing bringing social innovation as part of foreign relations. Will be widely distributed in Chile as part of the Chilean Biennial. Will educate the next generation of designers in Chile – great connection to policy. The most exciting outcome is a shower halo device made out of components you can buy at the local home depot for $17. It’s a DIY product. Un Techo worked with the home depot equiv. and the local TV to develop a campaign targeted to slum dwellers. Distributed lots of these products post earthquake then DIY workshops. Viral component to the dissemination.  Another success in Chile: partnership with Unilever who provided funding for community laundry centers (they place their soap there). 10 were built, 5 were successful, 5 were not. Not the sustainable model the Art Center recommended. They are looking at turning these centers into a way for women to make some income at these centers.  Several other technical prototypes built that are promising and under development in Chile. 
Un Techo has been in Peru for 2 years. Working in apprx. 20 slum communities outside Lima. Building transitional housing which are improvements on the slum conditions. Engage the community – there has to be an innovation workshop center in each community – start by building capacity. Don’t come in to build shacks and leave. Un Techo Chile felt there was an opportunity to Peru to expand and adapt innovations. Felt the community in Peru was open to this. Have identified 35 families in one slum community to develop and test innovations with. Goal is replication and scalability. Also different problems – in Peru, families pay for water out of a truck at a cost of 4X as much as the middle class pays – this is a big motivation to work in Peru. 
Sustainability of the program:
Feel confident b/c of relationship with Un Techo and lessons learned in Chile. Innovations Center within Un Techo is being funded long term by IADB in DC. Mariana is doing other fundraising through other sources, such as getting the airline to contribute airfare so that travel funds can be stretched. Grant and donation dependent for the short term? Mariana is working with Techo re partnerships with the Home Depot equivalent (Maestro) – they are going to go to similar partners in Peru BEFORE the project/pilot launches instead of after the fact. Want to introduce to corporate partners early on. 
Commercialization/dissemination models:
1)	Will explore DIY model and also bring one or two business students from USC to work with them from the beginning. Want to strengthen that expertise. Un Techo is very interested in the 1M person target for users. 2) Un Techo is helping to launch lines of shoes (Inclusivo) as a social business in Chile. Also launching micro enterprises – women designing clothing from clothing scraps – ecoclothing.  M will introduce the target of 1 M users with these students. Feel that scale is absolutely something students have to come to terms with. Viral replication and other business models will be explored, plus students want to continue beyond the class itself. eg. the shower device team is looking to raise $/compete in bplans to continue the work – 3) it has inspired the students to think entrepreneurially to consider launching their own ventures.

1007965,2011-03-08,Emily Hodos,"Feedback Call Notes: On the call: Barrett Hazeltine (PI) 
Lead student Drew Durbin not on the call, Barrett was not able to answer all my questions. 
Sustainability of the Fellowship: Barrett believes the fellowship will continue post grant with Brown funds. The College of Engineering has been supporting similar programs in India where students intern with larger engineering companies. They get the importance of experiential education. Looking at the engineering division the and VP for International Programs for ongoing support. They have been generous in the past in small sums. Barrett concerned about the same thing (fellowship sustainability), he wants to show what the students have accomplished and make a case for ongoing support. Needs this seed funding to get it started.
Student participation: 
Currently there will be 6 students involved in the fellowship this summer. There will be two teams, 3 students each – one does design and testing, the other looking at markets and user feedback. 
The intent is for the student participation to grow to 12-15 student fellow participating in the field after the grant. The intention is to create a NEW fall semester course (a follow on to Spring semester intermediate tech/appropriate tech course) for students from the first course, including the Fellows, to de-brief, write up what happens via seminars and discussions and to continue work on the business model and technical development of their projects. The new fall course will be named something like “problems in technology and development.” Expect about 20 since there are 40 in the first course. So the experience of the Fellows will have an impact on other students and they will have an opportunity to continue the work in a follow on course. (This was not clear in the proposal). 
Success: a model for sending students to the dev. world to work effectively on product design and business dev. Final design of cart and a credible business plan to get this into the market and onto farms. Main uses of the cart will be determined. Questions for Drew:
1) What plans for growth does Anza have in the next year/2yrs? How will Anza scale in TZ and beyond and how much capital is required to do so?
2) How many carts are in the field and in use? (Barrett thinks about 20) Have there been problems? Need for repairs? Is there a strategy for ongoing maintenance and repairs/a service business? 
Action: f/up with Drew and Barrett for response by 12/31

1007978,2011-03-08,Emily Hodos,"Feedback Call Notes: On the call: Traci (PI) – sounded freaked out and defensive, but came around. Not clear that she really understands what we’re looking for in terms of business model.
This town Vet Miray (140k) was the epicenter of the quake, dire straits. 40 year relationship with ND.  ND is part of a consortium that will do a systematic rebuild of the town. Town refused the offers of rebuild from other countries (Korea) in favor of ND and 5 other universities – 12 areas of focus:  water, sanitation, civil services, capacity building, residential structures, health, etc. THIS IS BIG AND MESSY.  Consortium also includes ngos and lots of private sector folks. Residential focus is what Traci’s. 
Plan is to make this economically sustainable. Gave an example of a previous project that was successful: Fortified salt production is one way to combat disease. Introduced this in the open market, it’s working, people are buying the salt. But the infrastructure/marketplace and production facility is gone with the earthquake. Now the salt vending happens on the corner as the market is gone. Philosophy is to create a sustainable technology (building panels) that can be put into the open market. Trying to undercut the competition, which is brick. (No future tense in Creole language!).  People earn enough for a brick and they stack it. So the panels replace this brick.
How far along is the testing of the construction models? Is there a demo? Ecoboard was supposed to be used in the US, did not succeed in CA. Process had to meet US standards which they couldn’t plus it was labor intensive. Panels do exist, company in TX is shipping to Haiti, but $$$ and won’t work post reconstruction $$ because of shipping and tariff costs. No one’s looked at doing this with sorghum, which is not an import model. Want to use core principles, but remove mechanical intervention and make it a human process. Technical development is around feedstock and engineering the process in Haiti, and use locals to produce and test the resilience. Until this is assured, they can’t move forward Traci said. 

Business model: 

Need to create a visible presence in the community. This happens through recovery effort. So far no recovery $ have made it to this town. They had a housing model (wooden planks) before deforestation. NGOs will be the initial purchasers. Consortium is finding the redevelopment $s to the town. They have been endorsed by the Reconstruction Commission – they presented a rebuilding plan. The town will get an industrial park and port, that is where the production facility will be installed. Temp. housing will exist, but they are looking at long term sustainable redevelopment. Market needs to be redeveloped.

Need a more detailed timeline, to specify business model development, which in the proposal doesn’t start until month 13. Have an entrepreneurial (GIGOT) center that does work on dev. world planning. Traci say they can’t bring them in, until they have the product. (I disagree). She is deferring the bus. planning to the Gigot Center who was supposed to be on the call. Some of the same people from Gigot worked on the salt fortification…We want to see an integrated plan upfront with a scaleable econ. outcome. Have 3 types of implementation models agreed for in Haiti. Have identified 3 channels – how will they decide which is most feasible? 

Mentioned MFI in the proposal - MFI is not part of the plan for residential housing. Want to reconstruct progressive construction (one panel at a time.) Encouraged them to work with the Gigot Center on the business plan/strategy (someone from there was supposed to be on the call.)  Action: need an integrated business model with (advisors from Gigot spelled out) that operates in parallel with proposed tech development.

1008011,2011-03-08,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Request for change in scope of work:

Dear Jennifer,
Because of the reduction in our budget, we will have to cut back on our scope of work, as well.  I suggest we remove the N mineralization rate assessment from objective 2 (see below).  This preserves the most critical aspects of the project—the production of the bio-fertilizer, its use as fertilizer, economic analysis, and recommendations for the future.  Is that ok with you or do you prefer to cut a different part of the project?
Thanks.
Jessica
 
Objective 2: Measure the plant-availability and yield impact of cyanobacterial bio-fertilizer
nitrogen. Cyanobacterial biomass contains N, but the N is not plant available until it is released
from the biomass by organic matter degradation; this release is called “N mineralization”.
Nitrogen mineralization rates will be measured by applying either dried or suspended
cyanobacteria to Ethiopian agricultural soil, and incubating those soils at optimum temperature
and humidity for 120 days. Total N, extractable organic N, and extractable inorganic N
 will be measured over the course of the incubation to determine plant available N and total
soil N. Results will be compared to soils with no fertilizer, urea fertilizer, and compost.
In addition,  A greenhouse study will be carried out at Hawassa University using two crops (tef,
the predominant cereal grain in Ethiopia, and a vegetable crop) and two local soils (a sandy soil
and a clayey soil). Cyanobacterial bio-fertilizer will be compared to urea and compost using
three potential fertilizer application methods: dried cyanobacteria applied to soil, cyanobacteria
suspended in water and applied to soil, and cyanobacteria suspended in water and applied to the
leaves of the growing plants. Plant biomass and N uptake will be measured to evaluate the
effectiveness of the fertilizer treatments.

Project started with grad student working on blue green algae. Been doing research for about a year. Got some $ from Western Sustainable Ag. program. Started with the idea of starting a for profit in the US and nonprofit in Ethiopia. Also have a grad student from Ethiopia. Jessica heard about NCIIA through Paul Hudnut. A lot of interest from GSSE students – some went to India and some to Ethiopia. That group that went to India & found out that fertilizer is heavily subsidized in India which kills the ability of any new innovation. Subsidies are nonexistent in Ethiopia, which means it’s a good place to work. 
Jessica went to Ethiopia to see a microbiologist there at Hawassa. Business students went a month later and they interviewed farmers and did a market assessment and looked at competition. 
Students are about to graduate. Asking if Jessica et al are ready to launch a business – some from GSSE students are ready to be part of a launch, including Ethiopian student. They haven’t figured this out yet, need another trip to Ethiopia to figure this out. Office would be in southern Ethiopia, Hawassa, where there is a  large diversity of crops and soil types. GSSE suggested a centralized plant model. Another model is to allow farmers to do this themselves, but they’re concerned about the sustainability – if it’s that easy to grow, there is no business. Have the nutrient solution to go into the pond and the service to sell. Tension between the 2 ideas. BRAND associated quality might be important. 
We asked for an initial work plan of what they would do on the ground if they got funded. Who is the brain trust – people on the ground or other GSSE faculty? or others from outside of academia who would be helpful in dev. a business there – someone there with deep NGO connections?
Grant would validate scientific studies – show that it works then go into an alpha product test and dev. a business model. Have soil samples from there in Ethiopia but can’t transport the bacteria. 
Original grad student and Jessica founded Thin Air with $ from Western Ag has gone partially to Thin Air and CSU. Start up out of CSU. Still in R&tD stage. The idea is to develop both in parallel. IP currently owned by CSU, but Thin Air has an exclusive license. Thin Air would be the entity that would be creating the entity (or separate org). in Ethiopia. Phil recommended getting advice from GSSE re having a US based company so that it’s easier to get investment. 
Action: clear work plan due JANUARY 7 re what they would expect to do in Hawassa, key decisions on who would be involved and that they are committed. Need to build out the business model re implementation. If there are adjustments to budget, let us know what changes would be helpful. Send reviewer feedback form.

1008020,2011-03-08,Emily Hodos,"Feedback Call Notes: Anna – worked at Technoserve, knew about this project and connected CU with Technoserve. 
CU team would conduct feasibility study of using jatropha seeds in a large scale for jatropha briquettes AND examine toxicity.If there’s toxicity, can carbonize into biochar (agri fuel briquette) – the toxins get released and can be captured. Could be also used for soil.

Technical success would be– how to make a briquette from jatropha seed cake. Might have to use other raw materials – urban or rual available materials. They will examine what the compositions are and where they can be used and replicated. Envision several versions using different raw materials.
Technoserve is already working with clusters / producer groups with different waste streams. 200 farmers in 3 communities, most are growing corn, beans and smaller crops. Small trees of jatropha. They have centralized production facilities for coffee, and producing straight vegetable oil from jatropha (producer group/co-op). They have a contract with a bio-fuel company. 
This team would in essense help Technoserve introduce a new product. Technoserve has paid for the team to visit and do a preliminary visit in October 2010. May even be interesting to Lemelson longterm. 
Cultural barriers? Farmers in October were excited about the idea, they wanted an alternative to firewood. Not sure whether using manure as a binder would be a problem culturally or not.
Need to identify – market study – where they can produce the fuel briquettes. Technoserve will do this. Interested in scaling up in other parts of Guatemala with jatropha, but also interested in different types of briquettes (coffee, banana waste materials). Honduras – oil palm producers. 
Does the team have a role in business model development?
Boston: not black and white separation of business model vs. technology. Market analysis will drive design…also drives the dissemination model. Students will work on technical feasibility and business model – supporting Technoserve in that role. In a class with Bernard, they defined the value added model for briquettes. Another eg. when Technoserve identifies the cost structures, students will play a role in costing the ag waste vs. something they need to purchase to come up with a unit cost to determine.
Technoserve will do all the training. 
Continuity – sustainability?  Longer term rel. with Technoserve is anticipated.  There is interest on both sides, but this is not defined. 
Second conversation: 
12/15/10: Call with Technoserve & CU: Eduardo (ED), Michelle from Technoserve, Boston (student) and Anna (Mortenson Dir.) from CU.
-Technoserve is looking for a research partner in CU. They have 60 hectares of planted jatropha (through USAID) in Guatemala and relationships with farmers. Technoserve will do the groundwork, fieldwork. Final objective is to combat deforestation. Michelle – want to add value to the waste they already have. Want to enable small enterprise with the jatropha briquettes. Wood is not always free/available from the forest. Also want to research banana, coffee waste and other sources. Not yet clear as to who the customer (rural or urban) will be – that’s what the market assessment is for. 
Eduardo wants to do a pilot project – have to prove that the product works. Good combustion and low emissions. Will need to design it so that it’s compatible with ovens used in Guatemala. Then a pilot project in several communities they are working in already to see if this works – will show a community how to make the briquette themselves. Cost will be labor. Then future scaling – 3 components/issues: a) economics of the briquette – the market study will tell us. b) what kind of machine is necessary to make the briquettes- do we have a big centralized machine or small ones that people can use themselves c) oven must be compatible. Expect to have a market study about when, where and how the briquette can be sold. First question is which target communities and then work on the entire value chain. By the end of the grant, they will have a tested business model, with individuals identified who can sell. Their goal is to set up businesses run by entrepreneurs, not Technoserve. 
Examples of other work Technoserve has done in Guatemala: They have 800 producers in San Marcos growing fresh peas. Organized them into 8 organizations who sell to a big exporter in Guatemala. Also organized 250 organic banana farmers, will start selling to Dole next year. Created a market with large enough market to interest large producers. Difference here is that the market is within Guatemala.
Already have a 2yr relationship with jatropha farmers, already know who the leaders are. Alfredo would set up meetings with those with interest and are willing to work on this. Would select the first pilot entrepreneurs. 
Future dissemination: Honduras (working with jatropha) El Salvador, Nicaragua, maybe Haiti – have Technoserve offices there, this could spread beyond Guatemala.
What does success look like by Jan. 2010:
-Technoserve said: what is the best way for poor people to add value to ag. waste. Leave entrepreneurs ready to create a business in the next 2-3 yrs and capable to train others to do the same.
-CU: figure out the context for jatropha seed cake, in context with the market. ID other waste streams like banana or coffee. Support the entrepreneurial efforts of Technoserve with the farmers. 
Sounds like they have a real partnership, with similar objectives. See work plan submitted by Technoserve.

Denver SE Rotary wrote a grant for the first toilet facility, they now have built 8. Ran into problems as they were building of course. Someone on Rotary from U of Denver (Peter) reached out to Renee b/c of her intl work on hygiene and health communication work. They formed they Kibera Working Group at U of Denver. David Kuria (founder of Ecotact) was working for Practical Action, the group that Rotary hired to build the first facility, then he got his Acumen Fellowship, and he left to start his own org with the Acumen model. He was supposed to be overseeing the Rotary project at the same time, but he wasn’t able to oversee it given time constrainsts – as a result what got built didn’t work as anticipated. He is very interested in their success as he sees it as a possible answer to growth for scaling in urban slums.
This summer Renee and students went to Kibera and looked at best practices, from these orgs/projects: Rotary, Ikotact, Ufinisi, Umande Trust, Kiyanda. Looked at what worked and what didn’t. She ran into the MIT students from the group that we are funding (I didn’t tell her that).
Lessons: 1) Mgmt training and oversight is key (some business training but not enough follow up and not enough incentive from CBO for sustaining the relationship which leads to well run facilities – communications and oversight breakdown) and the importance of social franchising model were the lessons learned.  2) Also looked at 2 biogas facilities, one was working one (running a propane stove) was not. Need further study re biogas. 3) The urea (urine into fertilizer which can be sold) is something David has been doing and touting it/starting to do it, want to look into that more –. Want to make sure it’s cost effective. 
4) Other learning – how to deal with the feces. Needs to be dealt with. Want to look at gravity fed leech field. Roads are precarious, hard to get trucks in to empty septic tanks. David has had problems with overflow. Rotary facilities are hooked up to sewage pipes put in by govt but it empties out down the hill…
Business model: Today Renee is submitting a 60k proposal internally to U of Denver (interdisciplinary grant) re implementing a business plan with College of Business for this project. 3 MBA students have been working on this. Recently Renee had a meeting with Gates Fdn who said they want to see an initial test of the model, which if successful they would be interested in funding a build up. Will get a letter from Water and Development partner and David re their support and role/responsibilities. 
How far along will they get by the end of the grant period? Rotary has just recently agreed to fund Jan-June an in country project manager to do training and monitoring and eval. which will be huge. Will be able to be pretty far along with the business plan – their goal is to develop the add on technologies and have an initial test of how this is working. Will do a random study of the 8 facilities and test whether the training and social franchise models vs those that haven’t had the training of the franchise model. 
Budget: Loaded the travel b/c of the importance of experiential learning for students. Doesn’t even cover all the travel, just the airfare. Pared it down to 6 students who would help implement the plan plus do the baseline research on the 8 facilities/evaluation. Told her 50% travel is not sustainable and she agreed. Her Chancellor is interested in this being an ongoing DU flagship program for new faculty esp. If they can show this is sustainable and of interest to external funders, he said he will help maintain student involvement. Renee recognizes that travel is an issue. 
Curricular tie in: There are 3 courses (college of business, media/film/journalism (intl health and communication, and school of intl studies) where they can work on this project, then interested students who want to work on the project and go to Kenya have an interview and application process..Most are professional masters students who go on to do development work not get PhDs. 
Overall: Very impressive – I was surprised. The written proposal does not do justice to the project. Recommend we consider more than FP. Fund the budget as requested but reduce the travel – they will be able to come up with some other funds for this.  She gets it and wants to create something sustainable.
A film student is creating a documentary on life in Kibera as his master’s thesis and their project is a part of it. Renee would try to bring another 1 or 2 film students along next summer. 
Action: Renee will send a version of bplan (taken from the internal proposal she is submitting today) by December 31.  She needs to define WATSAN system, description of social franchise business model, work plan and partner emails of support.

1008070,2011-03-08,Emily Hodos,"Feedback Call Notes: On the call: Ron (PI), Mark, Arne
Generous donation from an alum to do exchange program. He was a Fullbright scholar in Africa in 1993 and found Ghana to be easy to work in. KNUST has the best engineering facilities. RPI upper admin made the decision. Last summer took at team of 5 eng. students to Ghana. Ag waste to biomass energy conversion is what interested the faculty there. Might use this for cooking too, heat will be a by-product. WHAT is the product? Main product is ag waste to produce oil, but there might be other pathways. Want to make sure they are profitable in about 2 years. Might produce oil, gas and biochar and to boil water  - this is still unclear. 
Mark Steiner had his undergrads do some preliminary work – fact finding, scoping out the practicality of converting biomass to energy. Project team this semester, including 2 students who went to Ghana.
Mark: Cultural acceptance is key – usable, practical and low cost. Make some prototypes with KNUST and we’ll expose prospective customers. Iterate based on those inputs. Will continue to iterate on the design. 
Ron: was in TZ in 2007 and met Martin Fisher from Kickstart. Struck by cultural acceptance. Developing this collaboratively is key, hence the partnership with KNUST students. Have a couple of years before they have to be profitable. KNUST has an ag extension program whom they could reach farmers through. Expect the KNUST delegation first 2 weeks in January. Ron has a degree in cultural anthropology too. Has looked at the long history of failed projects. 
Looked at different feedstock, first looked at palm oil, then corn cobs – corn has become a hazard to burn.  Not clear where the profit stream will come from. Want to make sure it’s easily produced locally. 
How will they produce the machines and the products. Rob Chernow is taking the lead on the business piece and couldn’t make the call. 
KNUST anthropologists also interested in turning this into a research project – rural vs. urban, different ethnic groups. 
Action: need to articulate who will own the process, who are the entrepreneurs. Other partners beyond the college students necessary. Will the market bear the cost. If the team of students won’t be with the project long term, who will take this on. They admitted that they have not identified the driver/entrepreneur on the ground. Need to find those people. Students will continue to go to Ghana, faculty will go there. If we have a product that works that people will use, there will be lots of interested entrepreneurs. Could be the people on the side of the road selling hot corn. Who will deal with the manufacturing and develop the distribution network. Who is the Kickstart? Need to ID who will do this exploration of entrepreneurial. Anticipated this question and have already written to KNUST…will also get business students involved.

1008046,2011-04-08,Emily Hodos,"Feedback Call Notes: Been working on this for 2 years, large group of bike crazy people at MTU. John teaches capstone design. Large Peace Corps ME masters program. 25% of Peace Corps masters students are at MI Tech. One student saw a design competition by Cycling out of Poverty.  Did background research first on the market. Asked by the competition organizers to be a development site, to take it through to a business plan. 

Since the proposal submission: Have put together a design team – an NGO based out of Canada, and a well known bike designer (designed Tour de France bikes). Have scoped out what the final product should be. Working w World Bike Relief, largest in Africa – Kenya, TZ and Zambia. Have a Chinese supplier – will work on modifying the designs. If possible, do it locally for production. Have conversion kits, men to women kits and pedal kits etc.  Looking at developing solid tires. 
Distribution: shops tend not to think long term, sell one or two at a time. Idea is a bus. Wet and dry seasons – people only have $ after harvest. Planning a 2 season (southern Kenya, northern TZ) bus tour when people have cash, some entertainment. His student Ben knows Jodi Wu – Global Cycle Solutions. They don’t have the team experience in bringing this to market.
Have a written plan he will share with us. Pricing: need to hit $10-15 per kit. Manufacturing: will depend on the design. Sometimes would offer the kit and the necessary training. 
Plan is to start with 4 or 5 products – there isn’t one that is strong enough on its own. Will combine this with existing supply chain products. 
Goal this semester – develop kits and work with suppliers in China and World Bike Relief. Envision that it will be the students (MI TECH) launching the business. Group of 7 students now. 3 key team members: One of the grad students who is graduating and 2 undergrads are planning to take this on summer 2012. Key team members begin to graduate Dec. 2011.  Unclear as to their future sources of capital? Combination of US alumni and African partners? Intent is to launch a student business, students as founders. But not sure yet. NCIIA wants them to define their business model.
Action: send back initial business model by 12/31. Share links to

Rob said he'd be willing to work with Casey and Mark Steiner (who does have influence with curriculum). Sounds like Rob and Mark are close colleagues. He's asked Rob to think about taking over Burt's work in the future. Rob doesn't think he understands what it takes to implement this project in Ghana - tends to be conservative.

Meet David Auerbach - he is the leader of a young social impact venture called Sanergy which is supported by our organization the NCIIA. As we discussed he is interested in having an opportunity to learn from McDonalds as they put together a service venture to deliver sanitation infrastructure services to the slums of Kiberia, Kenya. They are pursuing a highly innovative approach that incorporates new technologies, ultralow cost service delivery platforms and an emphasis on superior quality.  I think they woudl learn a great deal from an opportunity to visit and talk with some of the relevant experts at McDonalds U.

1008027,2012-01-20,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"call with Renee Botta and Lee Elliot re progress and the water mafia: Renee- had a great visit to Kenya for 2 weeks in December - went very well, project is moving forward - they are very encouraged after being discouraged this summer. They  got water flowing to all 8 facilities finally (they have been working with Nairobi Water on this for THREE YEARS - a former state inst. now supposedly private but VERY bureaucratic, which had been frustrating. There is a water mafia - hard to even know who they are. All 8 are running in various states. Have been working with Nairobi Water for 3 years. Have hired a project manager there, he is continuing the talks with the water mafia guy Chris (which made their other partners nervous). Renee met with Chris who said the water would not flow unless he's involved...he wanted to be paid $1000  to unblock the water from Nairobi Water for first 4 facilities. He put his own piping in - between the facilities and Nairobi Water. Water flows 3/week and is stored in tanks. After they paid Chris, literally the next day they had water (after 3 years). He is not feared, he is respected and seen as an entrepreneur. He is probably paying kickbacks to Nairobi Water who allows him to operate. Next they have to talk about keeping the water flowing. 

Sanergy doesn't have to deal with water - so non issue. IkoTact does use water - they bought a water tank and a bore hole outside of Nairobi. So they fill their water truck and bring it into their facilities when they run out (Nairobil Water provides it 3/days week in the downtown non slum areas - there is no water flowing in their slum facilities - they have abandoned working in the slums.

Magino-Finisi (sp?) - WASH's main incountry partner gets $ from UN Habitat to build and then they hand it over to cbo's -and allow each community based org to decide whether to deal with water mafia. They house WASH's project manager. They want to partner in the implementation/growth.

Actual operation of some these facilities is now mostly run by newly formed onsite people - the cbo is not around...one facility has been vandalized a lot - also the cbo is not engaged/nearby. So they want community members to run the facility

Chris is called water mafia by reporters, ngos and Nairobi Water but Renee and the community see him as an entrepreneur - someone who will get things to work. 

Did a lot of trainings; project mgr will train new community entrepreneurs. Karen is going there in Feb. for 12 days. Did not take students in Dec, did take them last summer and this summer to collect data and figure out how to move forward as well as write a report on water governance and long term sustainability.

Hygiene piece - developed a train the trainer model. Wanted to train community members (community health workers) to be hygiene trainers...want to keep the motivation there for people to keep washing their hands. Showed them how to make homemade liquid soap for a profit. Showed them where to buy the chemicals etc. Now there's incentive to get people to wash hands in order to sell soap. Also had a deal to sell water purification (chlorine packets) at a discount and these hygiene trainers will sell it for a profit. Community health worker meets Avon Lady model. 

Have pulled away from Ikotact - still trying to figure out how to work w/Sanergy.

GROWTH: before the end of the grant, they want to have a replicable and scalable model within a year for the facilities and the hygiene. Beyond - scaling up. Looking at applying to Grand Challenges and other $$ from Gates. Have also targeted Pepsi and Coke who could pay for facilities in exchange for advertising on them. Growth depends on getting funding for new facilities (subsidized by donors like Rotary or Coke) then it becomes economically sustainable. It costs up to $10k to build a facility! Looking at how can that be reduced. However, they think there are donors out there willing to build facilities.

The toilets are franchised out to locals in the community who are running them as viable businesses. We are collecting the waste every single day, removing it from the community and converting it into organic fertilizer. We’ve grown from 8 to 35 people (80% Kenyan) in just 6 months.

We take off on May 3rd.  My stomach has been in knots for a week now ... I love it.  Ben sold his car, gave away possessions, quit his lease, convinced his girlfriend to move.  I have managed to get my wife excited about me being gone intermittently for a good portion of the next two years (this is good?).  The business has $90k of the $195k we are looking for startup over the next two years.  We have enough money to last until November/December, better if we can avoid a trip to China.  We are semi-finalists in the Dell Social Innovation Challenge and have made the next round in the USAID DIV grant process.  We will hop on the crowdsourcing bandwagon in June once our documentarian shoots a video for us and we can arrange some premium give aways.  More importantly, our batch of 50 final testing units will be on a plane tomorrow.  Tooling is locked in (although we have an opportunity with World Bicycle Relief to switch our sourcing to China and save money), but the material mix is not quite set.  We have supplied for some initial advertising, the unions are still excited for our arrival, we have a meeting set with local government officials, the embassy set us up with a business lawyer, we are trying to get a hold of the tax issues (and find a CFO), and most importantly we are just ready.

Just wanted to let you know that in the Dell competition you are given a mentor and they were very impressed with what we had done so far.  Several of those things were based out of what we learned in Boston.  Specifically, we keep going back to the importance of that pre-mortem.  We spent about 20 actual work hours during that week on that one document.  From there we had a huge list of open issues to track down and problems to solve.  It was of great value.  I have taught it to this year's crop of students.

Hi Anna, 

Really glad Boston has registered for this 5 day workshop (I plan on attending too). I just spoke to Boston today since he's registered for the August VentureLab at MIT in Cambridge. We are delighted to have the fuel briquette team participate and there's no problem with Boston participating post graduation. However, we talked about the fact that this 5-day workshop (watch quick video here  http://youtu.be/CX9ZOC0RNLA) is all about implementation and developing a business model. So, my thinking is someone from TechnoServe would probably get a lot out of participating. You have up to $1,500 in travel to bring team members; would it make sense for Michelle Palacios or someone else from Guatemala to join too? Also, as I told Boston, we strongly recommend that at least 2 team members participate since so much of the workshop is hands on and immediately applied to the project/venture - it wouldn't be fair or that productive for just Boston to try and do this alone. Of course you too would be welcome to come - it's really up to the team to decide who is best positioned to take this forward.

So let me know your thoughts - thanks! Jennifer

I've had a chance to read Mike's case study (thanks again) which I very much appreciate you sharing. How recently was this written (sometime in 2012) and have there been any decisions made since? In other words, what is the way forward?  (Given the findings, are there viable options for continuing this work - especially in light of Technoserve's hesitation to continue funding/support - such as using other materials for making the briquettes?) Or is the team ready to give up on jatropha and/or a sustainable biofuel enterprise in Guatemala?

Please understand that this is in no way a criticism; I value the hard work, candor and ethical approach the team has reflected to date; just want to take the pulse for whether this is going to move forward or not, and if so, in what way. I invite you / the team to share your thoughts on this.

1008027,2012-06-08,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Call with Karen and Renee - they will attend VLAB Aug 2012 at MIT. Long conversation with Renee Botta and Karen Loeb yesterday regarding their work on sanitation facilities in Kibera, Kenya. By the way, they want to apply for follow on SV funding and see themselves as process innovators, not just tech innovators. (This is an example of an SV grant that is closer to C&P vs. ET). Could make a good future case study; I've encouraged them to present at our next conf.

 Highlights: 

-8 facilities, 7 are for profit (one is in a school and services are free). These facilities were funded with Rotary $ for about $10k each. All are now breakeven or profitable.

-Each facility is now managed by a local community based org. Total of 5 CBOs manage 8 facilities. 

-problems they are trying to solve: access to toilets, increased hygiene to improve health. 70% failure rate of toilet facilities in Kenya so they are focused on sustainability.

-Products/services offered now: toilets, showers (cold), purchase of liquid soap, toilet paper, clean water (using waterguard) for drinking (huge demand for this b/c of droughts)

-Future offerings: hot showers (requires new technology), sanitary pads. good lighting at each facility to extend the hours.

-Each CBO hires the attendent. $$ flows from attendant (paid base salary plus commission) to CBO to oversight board made up of 2 from each CBO. Maji gets nothing, but in the future they'd like some profits to go towards paying the general project manager who works for Maji.

-Estimate is 6 months to set up, then 3-6 months to become profitable/sustainable.

-Growth/replication: no need to build new facilities, Maji (NGO) has dozens of them that they are willing to turn over to WASH. Start with 5 more in Mombasa and Kibera.

-long term: prove the model works, not just in Kibera, have enough data to show to Gates, USAID and others to get more funding/scale beyond Kenya. Want to turn this over 100% to locals. Also want data to prove improved hygiene is an impact.

-Learnings: slow patient approach to sustainability, attendents need to be literate (so they can report data), water mafia have to be paid, growth will be slow.

1008020,2012-06-12,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"RESPONSE to my concerns: Hi Jennifer, 

I just talked to the partners/TechnoServe on Thursday.  The crop is in its first year of production of seed (2011) and yield was 15% below expectations.  According to models, the yield increases incrementally until reaching full production.  The total yield in 2011 was 1100 lbs of seed, which was enough to produce 55 gallons of oil, all of which was used in the training purposes with the producers (none was sold).  They do still have the contract with SG Fuels who will buy whatever oil is produced.  TechnoServe hopes that yield will be higher in 2012 and producers will be able to extract more oil and begin supplying SG fuels.  

As for the byproduct of the extraction process (seedcake), our research team has discarded fuel briquettes as being unviable.  The option that does appear most attractive is the fertilizer, however, student research indicates that revised handling procedures and processing will be required to ensure that farmers/environment are not exposed to toxic compounds.  TechnoServe will be doing the market research/developing business plan for the fertilizer product over the next several months (contract extension period).  Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Thanks for this. My concern, given the current status of the project, is that I'm not sure what the team would actually work on at a Venturelab workshop. My sense is that it might be premature for the team to participate this August. The workshop is structured in such a way that concepts are introduced and then immediately applied to the nascent venture. There will be about a dozen teams working on commercializing their technologies, and since the jatropha briquette has been abandoned and the research re fertilizer product has not yet started, it might be wise to postpone participation until there is a defined product that Technoserve and UCBoulder want to get to market.

Please feel free to push back on this if you think the team is ready to participate, I just want to make sure the workshop will be timely and useful. Let me know what you think and feel free to give me a call if you'd like to discuss.

They strain the water and spend 72 hours boiling it down into ink. Used in cloth stamping process called idikra. Have not yet tested the biosolar reflector to boil the water and process the ink. Working on an automatic tracking device so that the solar reflector moves with the son - student Sam will go back and work on this with KNUST students - will make several. Ron wasn't happy with what other students have built so far. Another reflector will go north and be used for charcoal - a university up north.

Drew, thanks so much for the final report on the Anza SE Fellowship. First of all, congratulations on the progress made to date; 1000 carts sold and huge income increases for those entrepreneurs surveyed. While I am excited to hear all this, I also understand that you're at a major crossroads re funding and continuing with Anza so let me address that first. Unfortunately, I cannot encourage you to apply for additional funding - the grant was focused on the fellowship, not the company and you'd need to show some new/breakthrough technology to even be considered. That said, have you tried the USAID DIV program? Do you have other prospects?

Second, with regards to the fellowship program. I was under the impression (from your proposal and subsequent conversation) that you/Barrett believed that if this Fellowship program with Anza was successful/useful, you would find other sources of funding for future fellowships at Brown?

I've had a chance to read your attachments around the design process training that you/Bernard/others have developed and review our original grant agreement and unless I am missing something, this work on the design process is not what we've funded you to do. Please see the attached feedback form in which you outlined the business development activities, with the overall goal being to launch 10 microenterprises and developing ongoing business incubation training.

While I respect the importance of Bernard's role (and we did allow for some of the grant funds to go to him based on your request), I believe he is the critical technical trainer, not the Business Manager / trainer that is developing entrepreneurship content to the training.

1007939,2013-02-18,Emily Hodos,"Email exchange btwn Kofi and JKJ on 2/7/13: Hi Jennifer,
Thanks for reviewing our request. You are correct in noting that the materials that I sent you represent the kind of trainings AISE has been focused on, but light on business incubation. As both our original proposal and our response in the feedback form indicate, these design trainings are the precursor to business incubation-- without people coming up with their own innovations, or selecting innovations to localize, there is nothing to build a microenterprise around. We have been focussed on steps one and two of our proposal as they are required for step three to happen.

There are many reasons for the disparity between what we proposed and what we were able to implement, including a six month delay because the power company had no electricity meters to install in our workshop, but at no point did we feel we were pursuing something outside of the funded mandate. Perhaps this lack of clarity comes from the fact that we requested $50k, which was a more complete picture of what we wanted to accomplish, but received only $11k. Is there another grant agreement on file that outlines which type of activities NCIIA funded? While the feedback from the reviewers certainly directed us to think more clearly about the third of the three objectives of the grant, the funded line items were originally $5000 for Student Stipends and $5000 for travel, neither of which seems particularly directive about which activities fell within, or outside of, the scope of this grant agreement. It was our first approved reallocation request that looked at reassigning these funds in a manner that would allow us to do trainings that supported the first two objectives of the grant (establishing the physical infrastructure of the center and conducting design trainings) while also hiring someone locally to lay the groundwork for a Swahili business training that, which would allow us to make progress on the third objective too. 

One of the things we were not able to accomplish that was part of the approved reallocation, was the recruitment of someone in Arusha to work with Bernard and Daniel on the business training curriculum; we have people in Dar as Salaam who are qualified, but the distance was too great to overcome. Here I should note that Bernard is, in addition to being a designer, someone who has run a business in Tanzania and does have much to offer in the adaptation of our social venture curriculum to the local context. That being said, we did make some progress, and I have attached some material that outlines some of the basics covered in some of the early piloted trainings. It is absolutely true that we were ambitious in setting a target of incubating 10 microenterprises during the grant period, but it is also true that that was our goal with a $50,000 budget. 

The biggest failure on our part was our inability to secure additional funds for the project in a timely manner, something I assume NCIIA expected us to do when the project was only partially funded. We have made progress on this front and feel like we are on the brink of securing the kinds of funds that will help finally put the full model to test. A break in Bernard's service, which would be the outcome if he has to secure other work in the gap between funding availability at AISE, would severely damage these prospects, as well as threaten to make the $8k+ already invested by NCIIA fruitless. This re-allocation, in my view, is the best opportunity to get us closer to the point where the work of AISE is fully in alignment with the NCIIA mission. 

Would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further; hopefully the snow won't prevent us from doing so this weekend!

Kofi, 

I've had a chance to read your attachments around the design process training that you/Bernard/others have developed and review our original grant agreement and unless I am missing something, this work on the design process is not what we've funded you to do. Please see the attached feedback form in which you outlined the business development activities, with the overall goal being to launch 10 microenterprises and developing ongoing business incubation training. Perhaps this is embedded in what you're doing and I just don't see it?

While I respect the importance of Bernard's role (and we did allow for some of the grant funds to go to him based on your request), I believe he is the critical technical trainer, not the Business Manager / trainer that is developing entrepreneurship content to the training. Given NCIIA's mission, this entrepreneurial component is the piece of the (larger) Creative Capacity Building work that we want to support. 

Before I can address your request for an extension, let's clarify this issue and make sure that the work you are asking us to support aligns with our grant agreement. 

I realize this is not the message you want to hear and I'm happy to discuss in person - I'll be at MIT tomorrow and Saturday if you have a chance to chat?

1007939,2013-02-21,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"Conversation with Kofi; then I asked him to consolidate his request and explanation which he did: 
Hi Jennifer,
Thanks very much for taking the time to speak with me on Friday and for sharing these videos. I very much appreciate your willingness to consider granting us a no-cost extension for the remaining $2,628 left in the AISE account. Attached please find a reallocation request that includes the amounts spent to date, adds $2,400 to the Other Stipends category in support of Bernard's salary for four months, and leaves the remaining $228 in the prototyping category.  

As we discussed, our vision for where the AISE project is heading is very similar: we want a program that not only teaches design skills, but also trains new innovators in a range of approaches to getting innovations to market through sustainable business models. As originally proposed, we intend to do this through a tailored curriculum that runs parallel with design trainings, and, while we have made some progress in this direction, we have not gotten as far as we expected to in the grant period. I attribute these delays to the following:

1) Our initial vision called for a $50,000 budget that would have allowed for many more people to devote time to this project than we ultimately could afford. We were awarded $11,000, which was absolutely essential to getting us off the ground (thank you!), and we moved forward with the expectation that we would be able to raise the additional funds. Unfortunately, we lost a good deal of staff time to this pursuit, but now we are starting to get some traction on the fundraising side. 

2) We initially hired Daniel Mokrauer-Madden to work on the administration of AISE, the development of the business training curriculum, and the creation of a strategic plan that encompassed programming, fundraising, and community outreach activities. Unfortunately, a good portion of Daniel's time while he was in-country was consumed with managing the construction of our workshop space, which proceeded well until it came to getting the electricity turned on. The state-run power company ran out of meters and this not only caused a 6 month delay in our activities, it was an absolute time-sink that consumed a lot of Daniel's time. The good news is that the workshop is up, is running, and is great, and that Daniel was able to create the beginnings of a strategic plan, set up several key administrative and accounting systems for AISE that Bernard is trained to use, and did work collaboratively with Bernard to begin work on the business curriculum (I sent a sample session to you earlier).

3) We also had an agreement with a Tanzanian businessman and educator to work with on the business curriculum and to be the trainer once we had promising innovators emerging from the design trainings. Unfortunately for us, he ended up leaving Arusha to get married and to pursue a PhD in Europe. We then began recruiting a replacement, but all of the qualified people we found were in Dar as Salaam, and it was just not realistic to work with them from Arusha. We are still trying to find the right person to fill this role, especially since Daniel has returned to the U.S. and Bernard's strength is on the design training and invention side of things. We have a few prospects which we are vetting now, and with new funding on the horizon, we are optimistic that we can bring someone on to work on this before the end of the year. 

These are the main sources for the delay in our wok plan. Still, we are excited about the new opportunity that AISE has to partner with a Land O' Lakes/USAID funded project to engage women in designing agricultural technologies, as well as the prospect of supporting AISE as part of our 5-year International Development Innovators Network project, also recently funded by USAID. Our expectation is that some of the milestones we laid out in our proposal will be achieved in the next 12-18 months, and we will be sure to keep you posted on our progress. As I have mentioned, this extension will allow us to keep continuity over the next four months while the details of the funding from Land O' Lakes is worked out, and this is critical for us. 

Thank you again and best regards,

I think you know that we have been thrilled with the results of the Sustainable Vision grant that supported the Balde a Balde and Giradora product development (and educational program design).

We get the raw tube in from China, we then cut, join, package here in Kitale.

Sales to date are 700 units (nearly two months), with another 50 out in shops on account.

Projected sales over the next six months are just over 8,000 units total.  But the agrarian nature of things in western Kenya make the selling cycle really uneven.  Our goal is still setting the distribution network and the wholesalers, and driving sales through them.  The tubes MUST be only one of several products that we sell to achieve that.

Hello all,
Here is a quick update from Baisikeli Ugunduzi.  A great two weeks, but I will keep it short.

In no particular order:

- We made the national TV news and it resulted in two Nairobi distributors calling to make orders, and many sales
- We went to an Ag Show in Kisumu and sold out of every tube that we brought
- We are putting on a race in our home town of Kitale this coming weekend
- We have ordered our first full container of tubes, it will arrive in mid-september if all goes as planned (insert chuckle)
- We have also ordered a second product - tire liners that will work for those who feel our tubes are too heavy (these REDUCE flats, they do not prevent, and some testing will be required so only a small number are coming in)
- We have two distributors that have sold out of their tubes before our planned contact for a reorder
- We have phenomenal data about riders and their life-styles across many categories
- If your van ever breaks down for 24 hours, there are worse towns to be in than Mbale
- Harvest is coming to western Kenya and we are ramping up in anticipation of sales picking up by October 1
- We are heading to an Ag Show in Nairobi at the end of September and then another in southwestern Kenya on October 10

1008070,2014-01-31,Rachel Agoglia,"Ron provided more background info about why the extension is being requested.  Here is the content of his email: Why was this work delayed/not completed during the grant period?
 
Well we finally got the technology working in December, and just needed to ship the parts to Ghana along with making sure our partners there had the start-up funds. So from my POV this was completed back in December—I thought it was just a matter of getting the RPI staff to process the paperwork before the end of the grant on Jan 1. So the extension requests have actually been coming from our (very hard-working!) staff.
 
They have mostly been struggling with the issues of duty charges—it’s been unclear what import category the solar tubes fall under, and the tubes will not arrive until Feb 24 (had to ship by boat to keep the cost low).
 
The tubes were the key technological break-though: they are vacuum tubes commonly used for solar heating in the US. Turns out if you put them in a solar reflector, they are perfect for the heating applications we needed in Ghana. We are shipping enough to make 30 of our solar ink-making units. I will be in Ghana this summer with students (travel funding from another source) to help out and gather data on performance (economic, technical, social).
 
ICA stands for Independent Contractor Agreement. Our partner in Ghana is CEESD (http://www.ceesdghana.org/), so they are getting the ICA for $4,450. Our partners at KNUST are also still involved (two of their students are doing their senior projects in engineering on this). We have $2,500 set aside to cover the import duty fees. Hopefully they will not charge all of that, in which case we can pass the remainder onto CEESD.

1007978,2014-07-14,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"FR scored gold star. Hi Tracy, Hope your summer is going well. I was reminded today about USAID’s DIV program which a few of our grantees have been successful in getting funding ($100k to start) through. You are probably already aware, but here’s more info just in case. They like to fund proven stuff and help it scale so I’m not sure if the timing is right yet for E2E.  I remember you mentioned wanting suggestions for additional funding in your final report this past spring. 

A couple of questions - has E2E founded a company (in Indiana and/or Haiti) - is it called E2E? And what is the product name (I remember miray vet but that was years ago). Is Dustin still based in Haiti? I am so excited to watch the progress.

Finally, have you considered presenting at the NCIIA conference in DC next March? I think you have a lot to share…
Call for proposals is due Sept. 10 and it’s only 150word abstract. 

Take care, Jennifer

1008046,2014-10-29,Rachel Agoglia,"Extension requested - essentially they have $20K left and want an additional 12-18 months.  Here's John's email: 
I have a project grant that is expiring in December.  There is still money left in the grant and we would like to use it to extend the reach of what we are doing.

The grant was to establish student bicycle R&D projects in Africa.  Through the grant we have developed 7 products, including the launch of a company, and the support of World Bicycle Relief.  I spent the last year away on sabbatical in Kenya, basically implementing and researching on that very topic.  As such, I was not able to really use the grant monies (I was able to do the same work courtesy of a Fulbright).  Not that I am back, we have the opportunity for a new partnership in Ghana and a fantastically cool unfunded research project.  The rest of the grant monies (about $20,000) would be perfect for getting these going.

The project in Ghana is with Ghana Bamboo Bike.  They are lacking in bicycle and manufacturing knowledge and they hope that I and my students can support them as they modernize both.  They would like to do a series of projects with us.  It is my hope that they will fund my students going to Ghana to learn about the project over the summer while we use Venturewell monies to perform the R&D for this non-profit and help them launch new products and processes.

The research project is an open source concept for the on-site rapid prototyping of spare bicycle parts from recycled materials.  Working with Dr. Joshua Pearce, we have a unique opportunity to combine our backgrounds to develop methods of recreating as many replacement parts as we can figure out, along with the self-replicating solar 3D printers to make them.  This is an opportunity to create a new local supply chain and decrease part costs by 90%.  We are excited.

Hopefully Venturewell agrees in principle to an extension - probably 1-1.5 years, and you can tell me the process for making that happen through the MTU research office.",Internal Note,Completed,Normal,00570000003QASWAA4,Post Award Note--2014/10/29 Rachel Agoglia

So far been able to pay staff but barely. Probably neither John or Ben has the patience for slow / 5 yr growth. Need a sales professional. If nothing changes in 9-12 months, turn it over to locals. OR develop products for someone else to sell. Another option - KIVA partnership. HAven't found a partner to sell stuff through...trying to break into. Can't use remaining funds b/c BU is owned by John not the university. Want to repurpose for university activities.

1007978,2014-12-08,Jennifer Keller Jackson,"
KICKASS PRESENTATION: Dustin Mix and Tracy Kijewski-Correa presented to a dozen staff via bluejeans: Dustin was a sr. undergrad when this started. E2E’s mission - all families to be able to afford a safe and dignified homes. Empowering local entrepreneurs - creating local businesses that can build these homes. Market driven vs. aid driven. Need 600,000 homes!!! in the next 10 years per OxFam!!! One option now is masonry- concrete. Not many other competing options unless they're imported or donated -  increasing the cost of home building is not an option. 

They are based (Dustin has been there 14 months as country director) in Leogone, Haiti 20 miles out of Port au Prince. Core team is 2 faculty members (Alex and Tracy at Notre Dame), Dustin and 2 community members in Haiti, plus an Implementing partner in Haiti who was the first person to be trained. And 2 masters students + undergrad students who do R&D. Iterating on version 1 already. Large set of other partners - and it's slow. No mortgages in Haiti, no skilled design and building processes. Took 4 years to build the first houses this year. Had to figure out what went wrong with old construction, inventory of local materials/supply chain, community needs assessment (1400 interviews!!) re dignified home design and financial capacity. Supply chain, business model, highly visual construction manuals without words. 

Also built 2 full scale prototypes on campus. Won award for best undergrad project nationwide! E2E 2 is the intro course plus there are other student volunteers outside course. Also intl dev students who are working on policy are involved. Have had 4 undergrads go to Haiti despite travel restrictions.

Technology:  everyone builds their own house or hires the mason from their neighborhood - no regs, no inspections. Their solution is a frame and panel model - reinforced concrete frame with steel as the skeleton. Panel system is the innovation - (was going to be sugarcane waste but no waste at the factory!!) solution - one inch thick model with wire steel mesh with steel. You bolt on one panel at a time. Average is 700 square foot house in Haiti. Wood is not an option due to deforestation. Still using concrete but the cost is competitive: built one house in Leogone and second one halfway done. Competitive with reinforced concrete block houses done right (still cheaper to do it with inferior materials) -but E2E houses are safer and as cheaper than reinforced concrete. 

Next year they are piloting a financing program with 5 new homes in conjuncttion with a local bank. They are training local construction teams and are the liaison to financing. They aren’t a straight ngo giving housing away and not in the housing business/selling houses. They are In the space in between - to create a functional housing market as social entrepreneurs. They are very proud of the upfront work with the community. Asked what is culturally acceptable, what is dignified. 

Lessons - takes longer (4yrs to build first house) than anyone guessed, and surveys create expectations of solutions, people are eager for 100 houses a year. Shout out to VW for funding new ideas to do the research on housing materials - most intl dev. funders are just interested in implementation. 

Financing Innovation: 5 homes next yr -250-750 square feet. Buyers will go through pre-qualification process with local bank. Hoping to provide a 10 yr mortgage and a subsidy from E2E and have families create a savings component which is in tandem with starting a longer term qualification process - families entering savings program for a year which is essentially creating a credit check. Families will have to commit to a mortgage payment each month and see if they are actually capable. That creates an emergency account for months in the future where they can't pay.  Working with design build firms in Chicago on how to implement quality control, project mgmt.  Prices are going up for materials in Haiti due to boon in construction. 

Process: Pouring the frame is a one day process. Now training one crew on the foundation, another crew on the frame and a third for skin and roof - savings on labor costs since materials costs are fixed.  Do not have microfinance expertise and mortgage finance expertise in a place like Haiti - how do you design a financial program that really works? Lots of $$ from aid groups after the earthquake - but most of that funding lasted less than 5yrs - so temp houses are becoming temp solutions. BuildChange is doing a really good job (TLF grantee) - they are doing training of local builders - in a sense they are a competitior but the demand for housing is almost limitless. Haiti needs a few different models and types of housing. Plus Catholic Relief and others are in PortauPrince not Leogone so lots of room for more than one player.

Hard to explain what E2E is doing - people expect to either get a free home or a job. Their Innovation incubators bring community into design process - human centered design. People are cautious - they just want a house or job. It's a different way to interact with NGOs. Not used to that power dynamic.  Tech, building and fiancing are the 3 core issues they want input from community and find the people best suited to find leaders, entrepreneurs. Running innovation competitions and scored winners with a transparent process to find brightest minds. It surprised locals that it wasn't politics or who you knew but the best ideas won. Unintended consequence b/c it's a different way to interact. 

Status: NP still under university umbrella (like other Notre Dame projects that are global health projects in Haiti) and will stay with that for as long as possible. Helps with contact to donors and student R&D support so np by default. Balancing partners is NOT EASY b/c of all the pivots. Great personal sacrifice to Tracy’s career - this won't make her full professor. No reward for building houses. This will impact that timeline for her. Long hours - meeting with donors and alums and others that pan out and don't pan out. Alex and Tracy were strong early careers which helped and now they have 2 lives - traditional eng. life and social eship. Having prototypes on campus and crowdfunding - during football weekends also worked so they are doing a lot of the fundraising themselves. Many donors are students of Tracy's who are now doing well - forming a new advisory board. All b/c of undergrad involvement starting in 2005!!! She believes in unique opportunieties for our undergrads. Very grateful for our early support so they could take the time to find the right solutions (interviewed 1400 people in year 1!) VentureLab was amazing - made Tracy cry several times b/c they didn’t have a business model and it felt overwhelming but made a HUGE difference.",Internal Note,Completed,Normal,00570000004VlXPAA0,Post Award Note--2014/12/08 Jennifer Keller Jackson

We know there is concern regarding the passage of Hurricane Matthew, the effect on the community of Léogâne, and impacts to our programming there. Léogâne did experience significant flooding, and while we have no reports of lost lives there, the impacts of Matthew will be strongly felt, at minimum due to the extensive damage to the agricultural base in the region. We are pleased to report that the E2E homes in Léogâne performed very well in the hurricane, with no evidence of damage or water penetration. This certainly was a strong test, considering it was a Category 4 hurricane. While your generous support provided security to those within these homes, we know that few felt such safety during the passage of the storm. So while we continue to walk with the citizens of Léogâne in their recovery from the 2010 Earthquake, we feel it is important to respond to this latest disaster. 
 
As you all know far too well from the news reports over the last month, Matthew was the first Category 4 storm to impact Haiti in more than a half century.  There are few examples of multiple sequential disasters hitting a country in general and certainly not when vulnerable populations are still recovering from the first disaster. The impacts of Hurricane Matthew, much like the 2010 Earthquake, have been felt most heavily in the residential sector, with tens of thousands of homes destroyed. While this emphasizes again the importance of homes as a foundational element of a community’s resilience, impacts to local agricultural assets, resurgence of vector-borne diseases due to standing water, and impaired capacity to deliver clean water will present new challenges to recovery that were not present in the 2010 Earthquake.
 
In response, E2E has organized a reconnaissance mission over the dates of November 17-26, 2016. During our time in country, we will travel to some of the most impacted areas: Les Cayes, Port Salut, Jeremie, and Les Anglais. Each red dot in the image above indicates a home that was destroyed in these communities, reminding us of the devastation Matthew delivered. Our team will include structural engineers, wind engineers, coastal engineers and UAV technicians from the University of Notre Dame and the University of Florida, including two of E2E’s founders (Tracy Kijewski-Correa and Alex Taflanidis). Our effort will work to understand the intensity of wind, wave and storm surge in the event, the impacts on homes and other structures, and how homeowners envision their path toward recovery. We will be accompanied by E2E’s Haitian field staff (Lamarre Presuma, Gede Jean Benoit, and Edson Jean) who will now take part in this effort to build critical local capacity for future assessments.
 
We look forward to sharing with you all that we will learn from this mission, most importantly the stories of resilience and faith from the people of Haiti.
